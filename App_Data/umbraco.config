<p>iRacing attracts a lot of real life racers to their service.
Some come to practice on tracks they'll soon visit and some come
just to have a good fun bit of racing. &nbsp;I've started
cataloging these racers so you can get an idea of just how
attractive this sim is to real life racers, and how well their real
life skill translates to success in the sim.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="RealRacersList" />

<p>If you know any I've missed <a
href="mailto://rob.ragged@gmail.com">please email me their
details</a>, including iRacing Id, Name, series they race in, and
if possible their website/wikipedia entry.</p>

<p>As I've competed on iRacing I've come across many drivers with
different approaches to racing. &nbsp;Here I've recognised some of
them for better or worse. &nbsp;Of course, expereinces and opinions
vary but this is&nbsp;<strong>my</strong> list. Based on
<strong>my</strong> experiences. &nbsp;If a driver is on the No
list, he's been either consistently poor or done something
extremley stupid like drive around the track backwards or wait for
drivers to come by and then crash them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Yo list is only made up of drivers I'ved race closely and
had first hand experience with. &nbsp;They've left enough of an
impression that I'd be happy to race with them again any time, and
happy to leave plenty of room to ensure we all have a good time.
&nbsp;I trust them to return any courteousy I offer. The No list is
mostly drivers I've diced with on track whom I have first
hand-experience of their style of racing, or they've done something
massively stupid and it has caused serious and rage on voice and
I've seen the effects first hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Click on the driver name to see their iRacing profile and
statistics. &nbsp;Hover over the driver name to see my
comments.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I started off the week pretty calmly and using my standard race
preparation: &nbsp;Run the track with my default setup (32 Front
and 31 Rear wings), incidentally the same wing settings I've used
all season so far. &nbsp;The tuesday session is meant to be an
acclimitisation session to familiarise myself with the
track.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, Wednesday was our show holiday and on Saturday I am
off to help my mother move, so I'd lose that day of racing.
&nbsp;Wednesday became my Saturday. Fortunately I was quick off the
bat and my first race on Tuesday night was looking ok. &nbsp;I
didn't have time to qualify but I was up a few spots on the first
few laps and was sitting fourth when the leader went off and
rejoined the track at a slow pace, right on the racing line and
right in front of me. &nbsp;I moved to avoid and went wide around
Carousel. A bad thing. &nbsp;My rear left hit the dirt and I spun
off the track and into the wall. &nbsp;Race over. &nbsp;What a
wasted opportunity!</p>

<p>Race two was worse. &nbsp;Again I hadn't qualified and I started
12th. &nbsp;I didn't make it past the first corner this time and
was speared up the backside as the noob behind me completely missed
his brake marker. &nbsp;I expect he was caught off by the last
placed driver not slowing at all and spearing straight into the car
in front of him and to my right. &nbsp;I was out of the race on the
spot.</p>

<p>Race 3 and Wednesday morning. This time I decided to qualify.
&nbsp;A good thing too because I led from pole and won the race,
setting the fastest lap on the way and finsihing with zero
incidents! &nbsp;It was a boring race though, as I didn't see
anyone for the entire race, except for maybe a lapped car or two. I
went very unchallenged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race 4 and more of the same thing. I started from pole
(2:04.888) and ran away with it, winning by 40 seconds and
finishing with zero incidents and the race fastest lap.</p>

<p>Race 5 and I qualified 3rd in a decent strength of field race,
behind Paul A Nelson and some other dude, Steven Forster, I think.
&nbsp;I got Forster after about 2 laps and grimly held on by just
my fingernails to the back of Nelson. &nbsp;Riku the pro was fast
approaching though, at about 1 second a lap. &nbsp;I let him
through on about lap 13, not wanting to push over my ability in an
effort to keep him behind me. &nbsp;At the end I finished 3rd
6seconds behind him and Paul Nelson. They finished 0.2s apart, with
Paul just taking the win after running out of fuel on the last lap,
after the last corner.</p>

<p>I rocked up to a Time Trial on Thursday night, with a slightly
adjusted ride height and immediately did a 2:04.3 . &nbsp;I
couldn't believe it! &nbsp;Next Time Trial and I did a 2:04.2.
&nbsp;I jumped in a practice session just before bed last night and
did a 2:04.1. &nbsp;I shared my setup with a guy that was doing
2:03.8's and he managed a 2:03.9 on it, exclaiming he couldn't
believe a high downforce set went so fast on a low downforce track.
&nbsp;He was running 18 front and rear to get his 2:03.8.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>My set flies in the corners though. &nbsp;For my style, I've got
no understeer when I get on the gas when I want to. &nbsp;I'm
driving with utter confidence and it's gripping to the track
fantastically. &nbsp;When it does let go I can control it with
ease. &nbsp;A 2:04.1 puts me in the top 25 times in the world!
&nbsp;Much better than my races to date. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/296/laguna-seca-track-map.jpg" width="400" height="284" alt="Laguna Track Map" style="float: right;"/>Week two in the Star Mazda
series was looking good for me. &nbsp;I performed well in early
practice and got my times down to the high 1:19's (1:19.8 was my
best), which was plenty fast enough to do well in any race I was to
land in, especially given I'm in the wrong timezone for the really
high SOF races.</p>

<p>Qualifying for Laguna Seca was a bit out of order. &nbsp;Usually
I qualify before I race, in an effort to keep out of the riffraff.
&nbsp;This time I was really enjoying Laguna Seca and was
consistent, and my mate Andrew Kiss was racing too so I thought I'd
jump straight in and race. &nbsp;I did qualifying before the second
race.</p>

<p>Here's my qualifying lap of 1:20.066. &nbsp;I went a few tenths
faster in practice, but what can you do? It was still pretty fast
:)</p>

<h3>Race 1&nbsp;<a href="/media/261/laguna-r1.jpg"
class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">View the results</a></h3>

<p>I had my first race on Thursday night, before I had qualified;
something I try to avoid. &nbsp;I started from 6th place and was up
to third by the first corner, and looking good to slot into either
2nd or 1st by the time I'd exitted the corner. &nbsp;Alas, my old
mate Andrew Kiss was also right there battling for position and we
touched. &nbsp;Possibly I turned in on him or possibly he tapped me
in the rear, amid the first corner carnage. &nbsp;Had I qualified I
would have been on pole for sure and would have avoided this
mess.</p>

<p>That put me back to 7th, but I was able to quickly rise up the
field as other cars fell off and I also lapped faster than any
other car on circuit. &nbsp;I was in 2nd and closing on 1st when I
made a mistake on the run out of turn 6 and ran nose first into the
left tyre barrier. &nbsp;Fortuantely my car had no major handling
problems and I was able to continue, with only a loss of time to
the leader.</p>

<p>I finished the race in 2nd place, down 19 seconds on the leader,
after closing from a 24s deficit earlier on.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Race 2 was a was promising. &nbsp;I qualified in fourth position
and made a decent start, running in second place until Steve Owen
hit me on my left rear tyre while approaching the final turn of lap
7 and bent my suspension, putting me out of the race. &nbsp;He went
on, undamaged, to second place.</p>

<p>It was an annoying turn of events because Steve Owen is perhaps
one of my main competitors for overall division 4 championship
honours. &nbsp;We were to battle a few more times during the week.
&nbsp;I took a SR and iRating hit as well as lost valuable
championship points. &nbsp;From the look of the replay, it wasn't
Steve's fault. &nbsp;It appeared as if he didn't even touch my car,
or if he did, it was the slightest of touches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 3&nbsp;<a href="/media/271/laguna-r3.jpg"

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, not the best of races. &nbsp;This time I lined up again
in fourth position, immediately behind Paul Ezerski, the winner of
the last race. &nbsp;This time, as the replay shows and Paul
himself admitted, Paul took off from the line in reverse gear
instead of first! &nbsp;When I saw Paul wasn't going foward and I
made another awesome start, my reflexes kicked in and jinked to the
left nearly taking out David Buda who started from fifth. &nbsp;We
didn't touch, but my right rear touch Paul's car and it was enough
to bend my suspension and I vered straight off the road into the
wall well before the first turn. &nbsp;Race over before I even
crossed the start/finish line to behind the first lap!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 4&nbsp;<a href="/media/276/laguna-r4.jpg"
class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">View the results</a></h3>

<p>Races don't always go to plan. &nbsp;this time I started from
sixth place, in a very high SOF of 2763, possible the strongest
field I've ever raced in. &nbsp;I was running well, in fourth place
with a clear gap to fifth, when I dropped the rear coming out of
turn 4. &nbsp;Something I only ever did that once in all the races
and practice sessions I did at Laguna Seca this week. &nbsp;What
bad timing! &nbsp;I did battle with Sam Clark a bit during the race
and would continue that battle in a more races to come during the
week.</p>

<p>I still wasn't satisfied and I knew I had more speed and good
results and really wanted to get some good runs on the board.
&nbsp;I had to race again!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 5&nbsp;<a href="/media/281/laguna-r5.jpg"

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""

<p>Ok this was now getting crazy. &nbsp;I qualified 2nd and made a
good solid start and was sitting pretty in 3rd place for the first
dozon or so laps, unable to pass Steve Owen but not losing ground
to him when I dropped it at the bottom of the corkscrew and hit the
wall on the right hand side. &nbsp;I limped back to the pits for
repairs and was able to keep going. &nbsp;Two other drivers fell
off the track as the race progressed and I was able to salvage 7th
place and 54 points from a 2238 SOF race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 6&nbsp;<a href="/media/286/laguna-r6.jpg"
class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">View the results</a></h3>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="3vnO-sC1iGE" />


<p>Surely my luck had to change soon, and this race looked like
being the race! &nbsp;I qualified on pole and was led out strongly.
&nbsp;Unfortunatley it was a little too strongly and I again lost
it on the exit of turn 6. &nbsp;The rear of the car jumped out a
bit, as it usually does. &nbsp;I corrected, as I usually do.
&nbsp;Unfortunately this time I correct too much for the slide and
the car bit and took off to the right and I smashed into the tyre.
Race over when I had a good chance of the win.</p>

<p>It just wasn't sitting right with me. &nbsp;I could feel that I
had a better result in me and I desparately wanted to get that race
win at Laguna Seca. &nbsp;I knew I could do it. I thought just one
more race... &nbsp;This would be my last chance to race this week
anyway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 7&nbsp;<a href="/media/291/laguna-r7.jpg"
class="btn btn-mini btn-primary">View the results</a></h3>

<p>This is it, my final chance. &nbsp;I lined up on pole, with a
1.4s advantage over second place, and ranked #7. &nbsp;I was pumped
for a good result. &nbsp;The race was rather boring all in all.
&nbsp;2nd place put up a decent fight for the first few laps but
then dropped off to an over 10 second gap, which was all I needed
to provide a safety buffer, where I could drive well within my
limits. &nbsp;The remainder of the race was about managing that
gap. &nbsp;When I needed to I'd put in the a fast lap and pull out
2seconds. &nbsp;Otherwise I was just cruising, braking early and
getting on the gas late. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a good win, also setting the fastest lap of the race, and
my fastest race lap of the week, a lap slightly faster than my
qualifying time from last season! &nbsp;I also finished the race
with 0 incidents.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far this season I've had at least one win from every race!
&nbsp;Coolness. Next week is Road Atlanta, my first bad race from
last season. I'm looking to obviously do better there this season
and make up for a bad Laguna Seca this week. &nbsp;I've got limited
running time next week though, so I'll have to get my racing in
early...</p>

<p>Round 2 of the 2012 season 3 is at the Laguna Seca circuit in
California, famous for the mighty corkscrew turn. &nbsp;It's also
the location of my first Star Mazda victory (I was lucky in that
the fastest guy dropped connection and allowing me to ran rampant
on the rest of the field. &nbsp;He did rejoin, a few laps down and
proceded to go like stink).</p>

<p>During practice so far this week I've managed to log a few mid
to low 1:20's until last night when I increased my tyre pressures
by 2psi all round and immediately dipped into the 1:19's, with a
1:19.945. &nbsp;I was going even faster on the next lap before I
spun, at which point I ended my practice session for the evening.
&nbsp;It's a good sign that the faster pace is there. &nbsp;This
time is also 2nd fastest in my division qualifying and top 20
overall in the world. &nbsp;While many, including myself, have not
yet qualified, this is a postive for the rest of the
week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of drivers hate Laguna Seca, but I enjoy it so I'm hoping
for some strong results later in the week.</p>

<p>The opening round of the season is always a nervous and
dangerous time. &nbsp;New drivers have been promoted from the
D-class series and are looking to make their mark in the Star
Mazdas. &nbsp;It's especially dangerous for me, I think.
&nbsp;Because of my lower iRating I'll likely get the new drivers
in my races until my iRating climbs high enough to get into the top
SOF (Strength of Field) race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started well, setting an ok qualifying time of 1:22.018, even
though I've done 1:21.7 in practice. &nbsp;My qualifying lap was
set on the 9th lap of that set of tyres, indicating perhaps I'm not
running enough tyre pressure and the tyres are not getting up to
working temperature fast enough.</p>

<p>Race 1, with a SOF of 1363, saw me start from pole with a margin
of 0.4s to second place. &nbsp;Unfortunately I was tapped coming
into turn 2, getting a 4x. &nbsp;Fortunately it didn't do any
damage and I continued on in first place, with 2nd running very
closely behind. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On lap 3 Matthew Bretten sitting in second place and who had
tapped me on lap 1 gave me another tap that this time spun me and I
got hit by another car, putting an end to my race and all up
collecting 10x incident points.</p>

<p><img src="/media/182/brandshatch-r1.jpg" width="800" height="346" alt="Brandshatch-r1"/></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Race 2 was less eventful. &nbsp;Again I started from pole
but this time I got a clean getaway and pulled a 30+ second lead by
the end of the race to win comfortably.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="/media/187/brandshatch-r2.jpg" width="800" height="390" alt="Brandshatch-r2"/></span></p>

<p><span>Race 3 was similar to Race 2 but even less eventful.
&nbsp;After an accident on lap 1 not far behind allowed me to get a
10s gap to second by the end of the lap, I was never headed.
&nbsp;As others come off, I kept driving consistently and took the
win by nearly a full minute.</span></p>

<p><img src="/media/192/brandshatch-r3.jpg" width="800" height="410" alt="Brandshatch-r3"/></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The problem with my race efforts to
date was low Strength of Field. &nbsp;While it allowed me &nbsp;to
add to my win tally, low SOF races don't yield good championship
points, and that's where it's at for me. &nbsp;I needed to get a
high SOF, at least 1800. &nbsp;Race 4 was much better, with a
strength of fied of 2142. &nbsp;I just had to come to terms with
the very rapid duo of Mike Quayle and David Buda, also from
Australia.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Buda started from pole but lost a few
tenths at the first turn, allowing Quayle and myself to get by.
&nbsp;I stuck it round the outside of turn two in a got better
drive off the corner and the inside line to turn 3. &nbsp;From
there, Quayle pulled an eventual buffer of 6 seconds by the end of
the race. &nbsp;I had managed to extend the gap to Buda to 3
seconds but two mistakes on two laps in the middle of the race
meant Buda caught right back up and pushed me hard for the
remainder of the race.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">But it wasn't enough and I had the
measure of him through a few critical corners, enough to hold
second place until the end, and a rewarding 121 chanpionship
points.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/media/197/brandshatch-r4.jpg" width="800" height="388" alt="Brandshatch-r4"/></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span>I now sit second in the Division
4 championship table and 61st overall.</span></p>

America and week 3 of season 3 2012 of the Star Mazda series is now
done and dusted and I can reflect back on a great week. &nbsp;I'm
not sure why, but I got really hooked up this week, mixing it with
the big boys. &nbsp;The guys I did battle with had iRatings up and
over 4000, so it was extremely satisfying that I could mix it with
them race after race and over the course of a 20 lap race lose
barely 5 seconds. &nbsp;At one race, after a few races together
Danny Kane asked me what my &nbsp;iRating was and was shocked it
was so low. &nbsp;ha!</p>

<p>I also had guys doing 2:03.8's on low downforce setups try my
high downforce setup and comment that they never thought it was
possible to go so fast on a high downforce set, after running
2:03.9's, with me doing 2:04.1's, with an optimal of 2:03.4</p>

<p>My biggest downfall was the number of races I had where I got
messed up by someone whilst in high SOF races. &nbsp;If not for
that I'd definitely be over 2000 iRating. &nbsp;At least I got my A
class license back :)</p>

<p>I think I did a record (at least for this season) 11 races this
week in my bid to crack 2000 iRating. In the end I was worried
about getting a bad result that would hurt my points, so I
stopped.</p>

<p>At one point my win rate for this season was 50%. &nbsp;Now it's
about 25% (5 wins from 19 races).</p>

<p>I also didn't qualify before my first few races, again!
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>

<p>The first race at Road America was unofficial, and I was left to
do 20 laps by myself lol. &nbsp;At least I got to know the track in
race spec and got to know that 6 gallons wont last the full race
distance (stopping just after the last corner)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="f4HjBQiJWjA" />


<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I started 12th, after not qualifying and made good progress,
getting up to 4th before Milko Tas had an off and then rejoined the
track on the racing line, moving very slowly. &nbsp;I had to go
wide to avoid him and I put my wheels into the dirt and dropped it.
&nbsp;Race over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>

<p>Another unofficial race. &nbsp;This time I got out before
turning a lap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 4&nbsp;<a href="/media/366/roadamericaR4.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>Another good strong SOF (1993) and this time I started 8th,
after not qualifying. &nbsp; Worse, Junior Yearwood didn't bother
slowing down for turn 1 on the opening lap and plowed straight into
Sofia Stella who was right beside me going into turn 1. &nbsp;The
move must have scared Luke Dowding because he ran straight up my
backside, ending my race before I started to turn for the first
corner!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Race 5&nbsp;<a href="/media/371/roadamericaR5.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>This time I qualified (SOF 1535). &nbsp;And I started from pole!
&nbsp;Mike Quayle was right along side me, but I was feeling ok
about that because he's a good fair racer (3300 iRating too).
&nbsp;I led from pole and was never bothered. &nbsp;A good race and
a rewarding win to beat Mike fair and square (who beat me fair and
square by 6 seconds in Brands Hatch this season).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 6&nbsp;<a href="/media/376/roadamericaR6.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>Ah my old mate Paul Nelson, the iRacing bot. &nbsp;He does about
8 races a day, every day, and as a result pretty easily recoups
losses to SR and iRating. &nbsp;Last I checked he was on 1400
iRating and 2.5 ish SR with a B class (after being an A class
driver all last season). &nbsp;By the end of this week he had his
SR back up to 4.99 A class and iRating up to 2800. Anyway, He does
run a little faster than me, but not by a much when you consider
the amount of time he puts in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The real threat was also going to be the Pro driver Riku Alatalo
(iRating 5111). &nbsp;He started from the pits and was charging
hard. I yielded to him on about lap 13-14 I think, not wanting to
come off trying to stay in front, when I knew he'd eventually get
me. &nbsp;The race was pretty intense while I tried to stay in
front of him and not make mistakes. &nbsp;A satisfying third place
ina &nbsp;2177 SOF race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 7&nbsp;<a href="/media/381/roadamericaR7.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>I was running a solid 5th place after starting 9th, sitting on
the back of Miguel Angel3, after hunting him down over 5 or 6 laps
or so, when I dropped it. &nbsp;I manged to get back to the pits
and then set up trying to minimize the damage. &nbsp;While I did
finish 2 laps down at least I increased my iRating just. &nbsp;My
race time of 2:05.841 would have put me fourth, ahead of Miguel
Angel3 by race end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 8&nbsp;<a href="/media/386/roadamericaR8.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>Maybe my strongest ever SOF race of 2903 saw me racing against
another Pro, Troy Schulz (5848). I started 8th but this time I got
mugged as by cars coming up behind me. I think Robert Jones5 tapped
me coming into turn 1 and then bombed dived up the inside of turn 3
on the opening lap. &nbsp;That move spun me back to last place and
I set about recovering before two spins on the same lap put me in
the pits for repairs. I eventually finished 10th, with a +1 to my
iRating, the same as last race.</p>

<p><strong>Race 9&nbsp;<a href="/media/391/roadamericaR9.PNG">View
the results</a></strong></p>

<p>No way was I giving up that easily. I had pace to spare and in
this 2399 SOF race I showed it. Starting form 3rd, I pressured Mark
Ursel (4099) for the opening few laps until he locked the brakes
into turn 3, running wide and giving me the gap I needed to duck
through into 2nd. &nbsp;From there I was never headed, finishing 6
seconds behind Marcel Fachini (4139). &nbsp;It was a pretty boring
race once Mark made his mistake. I think he was catching me through
the middle of th race but I was able to open up a couple of seconds
in the last few laps.</p>

<p>This race was great fun. &nbsp;I staretd 5th and ran with top 3
for a long time, sitting right on Danny Kane's gearbox, until a
mistake of mine spun me off and I had to recover. &nbsp;I changed
back up through the field and finished just 0.1 of a second behind
David Buda. &nbsp;In the closing laps I was catching at over a
second a lap and it was pretty intense. &nbsp;As we crossed the
line David himself commented that he felt he should move over and
let me by just because I put in such a mega drive. &nbsp;My fastest
lap of the race as not far off two of the top three guys, showing I
had pletty of pace. Also this was a 20 car field.
&nbsp;Massive!</p>

<p>My final race of the week. &nbsp;I just had to do another to try
and increase my iRating and crack 2000. I only had 30 to go...</p>

<p>I came into the race ranked #4 and started 4th on the grid.
&nbsp;For the opening few laps I sat right on the geardboxes of the
leading 3 cars; they weren't getting away. Things were looking
good. &nbsp;Then I dropped it :( &nbsp;Race over, and Andrew Kiss
beat me by dint of finishing, lol.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I've been wanting to race this track, my "home" circuit (being
the only iRacing circuit from Australia), since I started racing
here. &nbsp;It was never on the rotation for the Skip Barber, at
least not when I drove the Skippy. &nbsp;I've done a couple of
practice sessions here in the V8Supercar, but my lack of experience
in that car made the drive not so rewardining.</p>

<p>Phillip Island is a tricky circuit to get used to. &nbsp;The
first corner I found challenging, along with many of the others...
Anyway, the first corner on my "default" setup was a handful.
&nbsp;It looks like it can be taken flat but then once the car is
past the exit the back end steps out every time. &nbsp;A few setup
tweaks later and I was able to take it flat and then I was on to
the next challenge, turn 2! &nbsp;Turn 2 is a tightening left
hander that also is a little off camber, making it rather
challenging and especially so in the early stages of a race.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could go on and name most every corner here as a techincal
challenge, but for brevities sake I'll narrow it down. &nbsp;It
seemed a lot of drivers were having offs near the end of the lap,
where the track drops down sharpley and turns hard right.
&nbsp;Many people were braking too late and understeering off the
road. I learnt to brake early, before the crest of the hill.
&nbsp;It's probably done faster braking later, but for me, that
method kept my car stable every time. &nbsp;Try a few meters later
and I was inconsistent in my ability to get around the corner.
&nbsp;Better to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to a busy week with my birthday on Tuesday and the
on-again, off-again birth of my son, I didn't get as much time as
usual to iRacing this week. &nbsp;I qualified on Sunday morning 8am
and was happy enough with the time that I wanted to go racing
immediately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>

<p>The first race was a rather high SOF race (2800ish) and being
fresh and inexperienced I thought I'd start from the pits.
&nbsp;With such consistent and fast drivers it was hard to make
places. &nbsp;The only positive being I didn't lose any ground.
&nbsp;I had &nbsp;zero incidents during the race and perhaps if I
started where I qualified I'd have got a better haul of points.
&nbsp;Either way, it was an ok race, even it if was boring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>

<p>A decent race. I qualified 4th, with the my two usual sparring
partners ahead of me, David Buda and Mike Quayle. &nbsp;I enjoy
racing these two guys more than any other because they're just a
little bit faster than me and they always keep it clean. &nbsp;The
result is enjoyable racing and I usually go better for trying to
keep up with them.</p>

<p>I managed to jump David on the start and held him off for the
entire race, while Mike and Justin Lindsay raced off on a tight
battle of their own, eventually 10seconds down the road when the
flag dropped.</p>

<p>Multiple monitors are a must have for any serious sim racer but
you don't need to shell out serious dollars for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The simplest and most expensive way to run multiple monitors is
to purchase a high end ATI or nVidia card and run either EyeFinity
or Surround, with multiple monitors of the same size and
resolution. &nbsp;It's possible to use the one card for three or
more monitors by using the Display Port link.</p>

<p>There is a cheaper method, although not quite as plug-and-play
as the out of the box solutions. &nbsp;The following method allows
the use of existing old monitors. &nbsp;The solution hinges on the
free&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.kegetys.fi/SoftTH/">SoftTH</a>&nbsp;(soft triple
header) program, which provides multiple monitor support in games
and allows more than two monitors to be used by adding another
cheaper video card.</p>

<p>My own setup utilises three older 19" 4:3 monitors (2 DVI and 1
VGA) and a 24" DVI monitor. I use a Radeon HD5850 card for my main
and an nVidia 8400GS to provide the ability to connect two more
monitors. &nbsp;SoftTH uses the GPU of only the main card (HD 5850)
for processing, so you may as well run the cheapest possible card
as your secondary (Ideally I'd use a more powerful main card, but
of course... :)).</p>

<p>This allows me to run a resolution of 3968x1200. &nbsp;Yes, I
lose a few pixels on the 19"'s but its worth it. &nbsp;The other
problem is that the 19"'s have a different dot pitch than the 24,
so the picture never perfectly lines up, but it's close.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1173/406383_10150558345078055_2058695515_n_600x450.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="cheaptriplemonitors"/></p>

<p>For iRacing I use 100% the softTH configuration
and&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the bezel management tool within
iRacing. &nbsp; <a
href="http://isimstation.net/community/modules/smartsection/item.php?com_mode=nest&amp;com_order=1&amp;itemid=10">
This guide</a>&nbsp;has the low down on configuring softTH.</p>

<p>I run my fourth monitor off the final VGA port on my 8400GS.
&nbsp;I use it for iSpeed and F1Speed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Installing SoftTH</strong></p>

<p>SoftTH is a dll and ini file that sits in the directory of each
game you want to enable softTH support for. &nbsp;When configured,
it provides extra resolution for selection. &nbsp;SoftTH is a
DirectX 9 compatiable program, so all your games will have to run
in DirectX 9 to take advantage of it. &nbsp;Hopefully this isn't a
showstopper for people and certainly in iRacing I don't notice the
difference. &nbsp;Games that focus more on gloss, like Codemasters
F1 201x series may lose comparitively more of it's lustre.</p>

<p>Download the latest version (2.08b at the time of writtting -
and it hasn't changed in two years) from&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.kegetys.fi/forum/index.php?topic=2123.0">here</a>.
Ignore the alpha wording. &nbsp;I've been running it for 18 months
and it's rock solid&nbsp;</p>

<p>iRacing's Season 3 for 2012 begins today, with the Star Mazdas
taking to Brands Hatch in England for round one of the twelve round
season. &nbsp;This season I've made up my own paint, with the my
work, Charm Health, as primary sponsor. I've also got Microsoft on
the engine cover, with my fuel sponsor BP on the nose. The paint
scheme is Charm Healths</p>

<p>Last season over 1500 competitors took place in the Star Mazda
series and I finished 77th overall, competing in Division 3.
&nbsp;This season I'll be in division 4 and I'm hoping to do a
little better than last season, now I know most of the tracks and
the car.</p>

<p>Star Mazdas are open-wheel race cars running on slick tyres and
using the Mazda 13B rotary engine, generating about 220HP. They're
the third step up on the open wheel road series which starts at the
MX-5 and continues with the Skip Barber car before the Star Mazda.
&nbsp;The Star Mazda is the first open wheel slick tyred car
drivers will experience as they attempt to rise up through the
ranks to race in the Formula 1 World Series.</p>

<p>I've has declared himself happy with the first practice session
for Season 3, at Brandh Hatch this evening. &nbsp;I lapped in
1:22.099s for third place behind 2011 Star Mazda world champion
Lawrence Smythe and iRacing regular front runner Andrew Cowell.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly for me, a B class driver, I was the first the B
class drivers and ahead of real life V8 Supercar regular&nbsp;<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Besnard">David
Besnard</a>. &nbsp;I even think there's plenty more to come there
is plenty more to come, after setting an optimal time of 1:21.622
and missing 15 minutes of setup time in the session after an
iRacing error denied me access to the Garage with a "Bad setup
file" error. &nbsp;I'm also yet to refine setup work and will
continue development of a qualifying setup &nbsp;through the week,
&nbsp;before focussing on a race setup on Friday/Saturday.</p>

<p>I'm also not concerned about the two second gap to Lawrence
Smyth. &nbsp;He's an Alien, and a Star Mazda world champion from
2011, so he's not where I'm aiming this season, only my second.
&nbsp;My focus is on reducing my time by about another half a
second. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've also debuted my new paint scheme. &nbsp;I like it :)</p>

<h4>The basics of Springs</h4>

<p>The springs are suspension components whose job, on a road car,
is to control the rate of compression of the shock absorbers.&nbsp;
Soft springs means the shock absorbers compress faster, providing a
smoother ride and keeping the wheels in contact with the road more
often.&nbsp; It comes at the price of body roll and changing center
of gravity, which makes the car feel like it's pitching and rolling
through corners, decreasing the ability to change direction.</p>

<p>Harders springs are used in performance cars to reduce the body
roll and increase the handling of the car.</p>

<p>In a Formula 1 car the springs are physcially attached a bit
different but absorb the initial impact of bumps in the
road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, the softer the springs the more grip
are car can generate in the corners (it can corner faster).</p>

<p>Springs also play a part on ride height (which thanks to the
undertray of the car, and the diffuser, generates as much as 40% of
the overall downforce on a Formula 1 car).</p>

<p>Springs in F1 2011 don't perfectly mimic their realworld
counterparts, perhaps in part because the game doesn't have
adjustment settings for dampers and packers too.</p>

<p>If you're care is understeering into corners and you feel you
have the setup otherwise right, try reducing the front spring to
enable more front grip.&nbsp; Beware though, too much and your back
end will be too loose and you'll lose it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>In F1 2011 pre Patch 2</h4>

<p>Springs in F1 2011 before Patch 2 were very broken.&nbsp; 2
clicks harder would result in a consistent 2 second performance
gain regardless of the circuit.</p>

<p>I'll start with same raw performance figures for springs.&nbsp;
As a basis for the test I ran laps of the Albert Park circuit in
Melbourne Australia for the middle Quick Setup option, changing
only the spring settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the stock settings at 6/6 the following times were
recorded</p>

<p><img src="/media/1707/6_6_springs.jpg" width="500" height="210" alt="6_6_Springs"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all else left the same the springs were adjusted to 8/8</p>

<p><img src="/media/1712/8_8_springs.jpg" width="500" height="230" alt="8_8_springs"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also peformed some runs with other settings.</p>

<p><strong>4 Front - 4 Rear</strong>&nbsp;: The car was
consistently 2 seconds per lap slower than with the 6/6
setting.&nbsp; The handling this time wsa noticeably worse in
comparison to the 6/6 and 8/8 setup, both of which felt
similar.</p>

<p><strong>2 Front - 2 Rear</strong>&nbsp;: The car was basically
undriveable and a competitive lap time was not able to be
set.&nbsp; There were two noticeable characteristics here.&nbsp;
When braking heavily the front tyres would easily lock and would
lock heavily.&nbsp; On corner exit the car would oversteer
massively (the back would come round and I'd be spinning).</p>

<p><strong>8 Front - 2 Rear</strong>&nbsp;: This configuration
removed the brake lockups but the car oversteered at a whim once
past the apex, using the same amount of throttle as a 6/6 or 8/8
configuration.&nbsp; Not competitive. &nbsp;See below for my
explaination of why this happens.</p>

<p><strong>2 Front - 8 Rear</strong>&nbsp;: This configuration
resolved a lot of the oversteer issues but left the car with
massive brake lockups under anything resembling a heavy brake
load.</p>

<p>In both the biased (front bias or rear bias) configurations the
car handling was terribly imbalanced.&nbsp; This doens't
necessarily mean that those spring settings should not be used at
all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oversteer can be caused by a number of factors but the
fundamental reason for it is because the front of the car is
generating more grip than the rear of the car.&nbsp; To compensate
for the behaviour seen by a spring setting such as 8/2 more rear
wing can be added, or front wing can be taken away.&nbsp; Another
possible cause of the oversteer is body roll in the corners. This
can be remediated by increasing the rear anti-roll bar.</p>

<p>What I find confusing is that a softer spring setting should
result in more rear grip and not less.&nbsp; It may be that corner
entry speed is increased, as the car would be pitching forward and
yawing, as it slowed for the corner, then the center of gravity
would be pushed backward as the car soft rear compresses as the car
accelerates. This should give more rear traction out of the corner
too, as the weight would be over the back wheels more, and more
weight equals more friction equals more grip (see&nbsp;<a
href="/{localLink:1268}"
title="How grip is generated in a race car">What is grip and how is
it managed</a>).</p>

<p>Spring stiffness also impacts greatly on braking. &nbsp;Harder
springs means the weight transfer to that end happens more quickly.
&nbsp;This is because there is less to compress and therefore less
time spending transferring the weight and force of the car.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, running hard front springs will make the back end
loose under braking because when you hit the brakes the energy is
more quickly transferred to the front and that means the weight is
more quickly unloaded from the rear tyres, tending the rear of the
car to step out under breaking.</p>

<p>The opposite is also true. &nbsp;Running hard rear springs will
back the front end light when accelerating, as the weight moves
quickly to the back of the car causing the front to rise and the
tyres to less effectively grip the road.</p>

<p>Since the start of season 3 2012 my car has been "sponsored" by
CharmHealth, my real life employer. &nbsp;I was looking for
inspiration for a paint and colour scheme and that sprung to mind.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it never quite sat right with me (mainly because I have a
pic of my car as my wallpaper at work and a coworker walked past
and asked my why on Earth would I want work to sponsor me). &nbsp;I
made a new paint over the weekend and this time I used another
hobby as inspiration: weight training and power lifting. &nbsp;I
search images.google.com for some gym related logos and one of the
first ones I came across was a logo for Snap Fitness. &nbsp;Perfect
because I'm a Snap Fitness member. &nbsp;I then wanted some
supplement sponsors and Musashi was suited my colour scheme, so
they won the secondary sponsor position.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my new paint. I think it's an improvement over
the previous. I like the red and gray swipe up the sides.
&nbsp;Looks cool. &nbsp;And notice the AIS (Australian Institute of
Sport) logo on the nose ;)</p>

<p>Week 5 of the third season of 2012 in the Star Mazda
championship saw the teams head over to northern United States and
the Mid Ohio track. &nbsp;This was my second race at this circuit,
having raced here last season. &nbsp;Ok, that's not entirely true;
I have raced here before a few times in the Skip Barber. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I had a pretty decent weekend from my 6 races.
&nbsp;Unfortunately unlike the last round I didn't have a trouble
free run, getting tagged by a few people in a few races, as well as
a few unforced errors from myself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Those aside, I managed to increase my iRating to 2245 and my
Safety Rating to 4.68 A class. It's never been higher. &nbsp;Unlike
Phillip Island I also notched up another win. That's 6 wins from
five tracks now. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying</strong></p>

<p>Qualifying wasn't too bad. &nbsp;I was running low 1:19.3's in
practice fair consistently but the best I could manage in
qualifying was a 1:19.6. &nbsp;I was being my normal cautious self,
not wanting to get incidents.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="Ub2Fdi4DQJw" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>

<p>I got reemed off the start. &nbsp;Augusto Ignaczuk decided he
would take the racing line through turn one on the opening lap,
when cars are going to be at least 2 wide AND a car (me) was right
in front. &nbsp;The result was his front left touched my rear right
and he moved over to the apex and we touched. &nbsp; It was enough
to slow me down and knock me off kilter a bit and Adam Surplice
behind me ran up my rear sending up both into a spin and he took
out a few cars behind him. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At least it gave me an opportunity to put some moves on other
cars, from pretty much last place. &nbsp;I moved up through pack,
avoiding some bad driving from Donovan Stanford, who was driving
both aggressively and far too sedately. &nbsp;On some corners (eg
turn 2) he was braking too late and on others, such as the more
challening turn 3 he was braking very early. &nbsp;He took out
another driver on turn 2 and then on the same lap caught me by
surprise by braking about 25 meters too early on turn 3 and I had
to jink to the right to avoid him.</p>

<p>I spun of my own accord on lap 11 and then spun again 3 laps
from the end, that time hitting the wall and forcing a slow crawl
back to the pits, where I still finished 6th, 2 laps down.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""

macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="3dzG9RCHh5w" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>

<p>Had an ok start. &nbsp;Nathan Growden nearly cleaned me up on T1
but thankfully ran across the pit lane to avoid contact (and giving
himself a slow down penalty in the process :(). &nbsp;I had little
battle with David Buda in the closing stages of the race but I
didn't have enough speed to make a pass. &nbsp;From there my race
settled down into taking it easy. Knowing I didn't have enough pace
to fight for fourth I cruised around in fifth doing enough to not
lose ground to sixth place.&nbsp;</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="p3BSQq6iw38" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>

<p>I enjoyed this race. &nbsp;Starting from fifth I ran well,
battling with Nathan Growden in the opening laps of the race before
settling in behind Robert Orton for basically the duration. I
passed him about mid race by later on my own mistake allowed him to
regain the position. &nbsp;The extremely rapid Pro driver Riku
Alatalo also made it up and passed me. &nbsp;I kept my fifth place
start position at the end of the race thanks to the pole sitter
retiring on lap 22. &nbsp;Good clean racing from me with no
incidents or overly aggressive passes (or attempts at passing).</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="MWCVmn_gjcY" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 4</strong></p>

<p>Got my 4th round win (6 wins this season) in this race.
&nbsp;Starting from fourth I probably shouldn't have won and the
two lead drivers opened up a decent gap. &nbsp; I had a good battle
with Sam Clark and Christopher M Payne but eventually made it
passed them both. &nbsp;I would have had another incident free race
had Payne not tagged me on the opening corner of the race.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="1-xJ2uCURbs" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 5</strong></p>

<p>A decent race from my perspective. &nbsp;Started third behind
Mike Quayle and looked like I might get past him on the opening
lap. I even had a go on turn two, but he got superior drive out of
the corner and took me back down the straight and it was all over.
&nbsp;He and Paul Nelson edged away at about 0.5s per lap and I
took third place. &nbsp;An otherwise eventless race. &nbsp;I
recorded a bit of Andrew Kiss racing, just to get a perspective
from down the back of the grid.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="mtbFPehtnsQ" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 6</strong></p>

<p>My final race of the round. Decent SOF and I started 5th, behind
Mike Quayle, again! /sigh. &nbsp;This time he lost it on turn 1 and
I made it by into 3rd, where I sat for a while. &nbsp;The lead
driver eventually lost control of his car and I was into 2nd, where
I stayed until the end of the race :)</p>

<p>I just sat down to watch the 2012 Sandown 500. &nbsp;It's been a
while since I've had the time to watch a V8Supercar race (usually
I'm preoccuppied playing iRacing :)). &nbsp;As the commentators
went through the entry list I was amazed at the number of names I
knew, not from V8Supercars, but from racing them on iRacing.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last weekend I had a chat about V8Supercar drivers to a guy I
met a kids birthday party I was at with my kids. &nbsp;He insisted
that either (a) the drivers with these names are imposters or (b)
the drivers get paid by iRacing to appear, just to add some
credibility to the "game". &nbsp;</p>

<p>We who love iRacing know better. &nbsp;These guys are here to
race, and they're fast. &nbsp;In iRacing they're just like anyone
else. They get angry, they rage, they laugh, and they talk with all
the other drivers they're racing against. &nbsp;Ultimately they're
on iRacing to have fun and do more of what they love to do, race
cars, even if it is virtually.</p>

<p>Watching the Sandown has compelled me to compile a list of
drivers currently registerd on iRacing, and from what I can see
they're all regular and recent competitors :)</p>

<p><strong>Shane Van Gisbergen (SP Tools Falcon)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Steve Owen (VIP Petfoods Falcon)</strong></p>

<p>(Who was my nemesis in the earlier rounds of this seasons Star
Mazda but sadly I haven't seen him for a few weeks)</p>

<p><a href="/media/651/Steve%20Owen.PNG"><img src="/media/651/Steve Owen.PNG" width="500" height="350" alt="Steve Owen"/></a></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Registered but no races</p>

<p>The following drivers are registered but have no races.
&nbsp;Perhaps they use the Testing functionality only? &nbsp;:)</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do?custid=94269">
Luke Youlden</a></p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do?custid=77450">
Garth Tander</a></p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do?custid=103225">
Lee Holdsworth</a></p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do?custid=77606">
Chris Pither</a></p>

<p>There are probably more but I've no way to be nearly certain
it's them, so I've left them off. I've personally raced all the
guys in bold and with details attached and chatted with them on
voice in practice sessions and on the grid before races. &nbsp;I
can't get anywhere near The Gis and McLaughlin, but the others are
regularly dicing with me and I'm winning :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Surely there has to be a good reason why so many top
drivers race on iRacing? &nbsp;I strongly doubt this many guys are
regularly competing/playing Codemasters F1 2011 for example.
&nbsp;That's a pretty strong endorsement of the simulation
qualities of iRacing</strong></p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I don't mind me some Suzuka. &nbsp;It's not that I do well here;
I don't compared to some other tracks. &nbsp;It's more about Suzuka
being a real drivers track, like Spa. &nbsp;The Esses (3, 4, 5, 6,
7) in the first half of the lap require a well balanced car and a
smooth driving style. &nbsp;It's a challenge to string together a
great time in that section. &nbsp;But it's not just there, that
carries on to many corners of the track, including the two Degners
(8 &amp; 9) before you pass under the bridge, and especially the
mighty Spoon.</p>

<p><img src="/media/607/suzuka-trackmap.png" width="600" height="380" alt="Suzuka-trackmap" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p>

<p>Much is spoken of 130R in Formula 1, but for me, one of the
hardest corners to get right not just on this track but on the
Calendar is Spoon (13). &nbsp;Spoon is the last coner before the
back straight that bleeds into 130R (14) and it requires
positioning the car exactly, if you want a good run down that
straight. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Another tough corner, where I can lose half a second in one
(two) corners it the chicane (15 &amp; 16) at the end of the lap.
&nbsp;Heavy braking with a bit of turning. &nbsp;There's easily
0.3s found in the corner by getting the brakes exactly right and
from my experience it's very hard to do consistently. &nbsp;In
fact, my fastest lap to date, 1:58.1 is an example of where I got
it right. &nbsp;I've managed a number of 1:58.3's, but I lose bulk
time in that corner every time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying</strong></p>

<p>A decent enough session. &nbsp;My qualifying time ended up about
3/10ths of a second off my best lap time in practice, which is
pretty typical unfortunately. &nbsp;I could have tried to get
closer to that mark, but it probably wouldn't have made much
difference, in retrospect. &nbsp;</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="iB_oJe1q4cc" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race 1</p>

<p>My first race at Suzuka for the season was the highest SOF race
of the week, a 2800+ race with some very fast drivers. I qualified
7th, just 0.06s behind David Buda, which brought a smile to my
face, because we tend to end up at about the same pace at most
tracks. &nbsp;True to form, we left the line neck and neck, with me
getting the jump on him off the line. &nbsp;He slid on turn one of
lap two but caught it, losing about 1 second but within a few laps
he was on the back of me again. Thankfully you need a good speed
difference to make a move here and the opportunities are scare.
&nbsp;He seemed to have my measure through turn one and two, but
you can't pass there, not on the outside anyway. &nbsp;At the
halfway mark Stanislav Shubin was about 7 seconds back, he'd gain a
couple of seconds but then lose them again, presumably making a
mistake. &nbsp;At lap 15 I'd been watching the gap between David
and Me, and Stanislav close pretty quickly and I started to get
worried about having only 2.1s deficit and 5 laps to try and
defend.</p>

<p>Going into turn 8 I thought I'd brake an few meters later and
try and get some more speed. &nbsp;I should have remembered the
pact I made to myself about 6 months ago: Don't try new shit in the
race, ever. &nbsp;I went a little bit too fast and into the turn
and consequently ran a little wide and lost the back end. &nbsp;I
spun and both David and Stanislav got by. &nbsp;The broken braked
Nathan Growden, who seems a bit hapless of late, wasn't a threat a
lap down, and I had no chance of recatching Stanislav on ruined
tyres so I cruised in, settling on keeping the car in one piece and
collecting a few points. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I realised before midway point that I didn't drop the pressures
in my tyres and that while giving me strong initial pace was
probably my undoing toward the end of the race. &nbsp;I corrected
the problem for future races.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="jdO7z20JPKA" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>

<p>I was pumped for race two (10:30am on the Saturday). &nbsp;With
the fun of race 1 and the switch to lower pressure tyres I was
confident of a strong result and a fun race. &nbsp;It was a good
field and I qualified 5th. &nbsp;Alas, Nathan Growden had a
cracking start and took the inside into turn 1. &nbsp;In the replay
you can see me moving right to give him space, but it wasn't
enough. &nbsp;He got a wobble on on accelleration and ghost touched
me through turn 2 and we met in a collision that ended both our
races. &nbsp;In the replay it looks like he made contact with the
stalled car in front of him and that bent the right side of his
front wing, which would have changed the handling of his car.
&nbsp;Short but definitely not sweet.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="l2-NiCwa9Cg" />


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>

<p>Nathan Growden was in the race too and at the start we had a
little joke about the last race and I mentioned in general that
it'd be nice to not have anyone crash at turn 1. Especially into
me.</p>

<p>I had a cracking start and gunned it past Mike Quayle off the
line and pulled right and alongside Scott Gray2. &nbsp;We touched
as we turned into turn 1 and at first I thought I caused a massive
pile up, as there was some serious carnage behind me. &nbsp;I felt
like a right twat in light of what I said on the grid. Once I got a
chance to look at the replay it seemed like Scott Gray2 turned into
me and hit my sidepod, which unsettled him and he took out Mike
Quayle. &nbsp; From there I had a 4 second gap to second which
eventaually turned into almost no gap at all as after 15 laps Scott
had hauled me back in. &nbsp;A positive was that Mike Quayle wasn't
catching me and was about a consistent 20 seconds behind.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>For about three laps Scott and I went at it with 0.3s seperating
us. &nbsp;Intense and I was getting increasing nervous about an
upcoming move. &nbsp;At least it's hard to pass around Suzuka and
Scott had the sense to not try and force something that was never
going to come off unless I made a mistake. &nbsp;Thankfully for me
his wheel stopped working with 3 laps to go and he crashed straight
into a wall. &nbsp;I cruised the last few laps and Mike Quayle
closed a second or so. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking back at the replay after the event, there's pretty much
no way Scott Gray would have seen me alongside if he didn't have
triple screens (I have triples, so my view is at least a bit
larger). &nbsp;Actually I guess if he was running an
insane-for-one-screen FOV he may have seen me... &nbsp;No hard
feelings on my part though (especially seeing as I won!).</p>

<p>That win means I've won at every track except Phillip Island
this season. I only ran two races at PI and the first one was a
3000 SOF where I started from the pits. &nbsp;Technically I haven't
won at Iowa either, but I didn't run there...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 4</strong></p>

<p>A strange start. &nbsp;I got off the line ok but then going into
turn 1, Bram Den Boer, who started behind me shot up the inside and
across my nose and then off the track, taking out (thankfully) the
rapid Nenad Matijevic. From there, the entire race was about
examining Robert Ortons gearbox. &nbsp;Had I of qualified again,
with a time closer to my practice pace I'd have been in front of
Robert on the grid and would probably have finished third.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I followed him within a second for literally the entire race,
bar about half a lap when I overcooked it into turn 11 and lost a
full second. &nbsp;I tried like heck with 2 laps to go but as was
the theme in other races this week, I wasn't able to pass. &nbsp;At
least the other two times it was others trying to pass me!</p>

<p>Crazy start antics ensues in the vid.</p>

<p>Race 3 last Saturday at Suzuka and I lined up third on the grid
behind Mike Quayle in second and Scott Gray in third (no
relation!). I made a cracking start which resulted in Scott
probably turning in to me (we did collide, that's refutable but his
turning in on me was accidental - and I could't go more left
because Mike was on my inside we went 3 deep into turn 1 (mad I
know!).</p>

<p>Anyway, we got to talking briely on the forums and then via PM,
where I learnt he also lives in Brisbane, just like me. Further
talking and he lives in the suburb next me! And here we are two
random guys with the same surname (and his dad shared my name -
Robert Gray!) racing one another on a computer game, when we live
less than a kilometer away.</p>

<p>Funny!</p>

<p>First day of Spa and I set out on my Season 2 set and did a
2:17.839. &nbsp;To be fair that was with a massive tow down the
main straight at the top of the hill. &nbsp;I was setting 2:18.3's
consistently by myself, which would have still put me at the top.
None of the big boys were out though, but there were plenty of div
3 and 2 drivers.</p>

<p>Spa-rring.. Geddit? As in Sparring: what you do when you
practice fighting. ...Annnnyyywaaayyy...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I threw normal caution out the window for race 1 and raced
without first qualifying. &nbsp;Not the best idea at the best of
times and probably not a great idea at Spa, the track that caused
my downfall last season. &nbsp;Last season, at this track, I went 7
races without finish! I even spun out of the lead twice. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping this season, my second in the Mazda powered formula
car, my Spa effort would be better. I was hoping I'd come the
Belgian circuit a more composed and experienced race driver, my
racecraft significantly honed.</p>

<p>I've just done my first race and what a cracker. &nbsp;I started
fourth, the second of the non-qualifiers, behind Jed Jury.
&nbsp;Jury's a familiar face but I haven't raced him much this
season. &nbsp;Most of the field was filled with C class drivers...
&nbsp;Of the line one of those C-class drivers shot it up the
inside into la source, the first corner - a hairpin. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Knowing what a bogey track this was for me last season I left
&nbsp;big gap and stuck way wide: right to the edge. &nbsp;He went
up into fourth position no problem and started battling intensely
with 2nd (another C class and 2nd qualifier) and Jed Jury.
&nbsp;All three were weaving about the track jockeying for
position. &nbsp;All the while I hung back waiting for the
eneviatble incident at the top of the hill. Sure enough, it came
and the two C-class drivers when spearing off into the wall after
colliding with each other!</p>

<p>For the next 8 laps Jed Jury and I had an intense battle as I
run right on his gearbox. &nbsp;Each tour around I noticed he was
significantly slower through the first few corners at the top of
the hill and as I closed right up to him on lap 10 he made a
mistake and I was able to slip through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wasn't able to shake him though and after a few more laps I
made another small mistake (no incidents though) through eu rouge
and he got past on top speed down the straight. &nbsp;We again
battled closely but a few laps later he collided with a backmaker
again at the top of the hill and he race was run. &nbsp;From there
it was a completely clear run in 2nd. &nbsp;Mike Quayle (again! :))
was in the lead by about 14 seconds now and I wasn't going to catch
him and 3rd place was half a minute back. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Toward the end Mike had a little slide and lost 4 seconds.
&nbsp;It wasn't enough and I finsihed the race in second place.
&nbsp;Only one incident. Unfortunately it was a pretty low SOF and
I only collected 91 points. &nbsp;9 short of my self prescribed 100
per race goal. &nbsp;Mike collected 99 for the win...</p>

<p>My 2nd sesaon in the Star Mazda series has come to end and it's
been a good season but not great. &nbsp;At the start of the season
I had two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish in the top 50 overall</li>

<li>Win my Division (4)</li>
</ol>

<p>I led Division 4 from round 4 until the final round. &nbsp;Only
on the last day of racing of the entire season did I lose my number
spot and finish number 2. &nbsp;Still, number two isn't bad, but I
did want to finish at the top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've made some progress...</p>

<p><a href="/media/704/star-mazda-progress.PNG"><img src="/media/704/star-mazda-progress.png" width="500" height="55" alt="starmazdaprogress" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, a poor result at a track I love, Watkins Glen, did
me in. Looking at the race results between Robert Orton and myself,
he raced only the once - with success (a 2nd place and 120 points).
I had 14 races with varying success including two 133 point
finishes and a few other finishes about 110. &nbsp;I also had a 8
DNF's and that is what broke me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congratulations to Robert Orton though. &nbsp;I've raced him a
few times throughout the season and it has always been very close.
&nbsp;Unfortunately we rarely raced head-to-head. &nbsp;Scott
McIntyre was the same. &nbsp;He raced strongly the few times I
raced him (always at Motegi if I recall correctly).</p>

<p>I did score a win at 7 of the 12 rounds though, so that was a
big plus. &nbsp;I also saw my iRating increase from in the 1500's
to nearly 2800. It's now down just below 2700 after the disaster of
Watkins Glen. &nbsp;I've also now been promoted to Division 2.
&nbsp;That will be very tough and I don't think I stand a chance.
&nbsp;I was generally competing against Mike Quayle, David Buda,
Nathan Gowden and a few others, and we had a great time racing
cleanly and fairly. &nbsp;Really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I finished 54th overall, not quit enough. &nbsp;Again
that darn Watkins Glen let me down :(</p>

<p>I think I'll do another season in the Star Mazda, although I
want to race the Lotus 49, and prep for next years assault on the
V8 Supercar.</p>

<p>Season 3 of 2012 was Ragged Racing's best season to date. I took
2nd place in the Star Mazda series, losing the lead on the very
last day of competition! &nbsp;If only I had a better run at
Watkins Glen...</p>

<p>A corner-stone of the "complete" F1 experience is telemetry.
Despite Codemasters marketing F1 2011 as living the life of an F1
racer, and being a complete package, the game doesn't come with
accessible telemetry out of the box; probably to make it easy
enough for console gamers.</p>

<p>PC users don't have such limitations and there is a way to get
access to telemetry data.&nbsp; I noticed there is a telemetry
folder for the various Codemasters F1 games, but the files are
binary.&nbsp; I went looking on the Internet...</p>

<p>I wrote my own.&nbsp; F1Speed also captures telemetry from
Codemasters F1 games and logs to disk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Capturing Telemetry</h4>

<p>The F1Speed application needs to be running while your
Codemasters F1 game is running and listens for telemetry published
by the game.&nbsp; For details on setting up F1Speed, see the link
above.</p>

<p>F1Speed captures each full lap you complete providing you have
set a circuit and a lap type. Data is saved to your&nbsp;<strong>My
Documents\F1Speed\F1PerfView Data</strong>&nbsp;folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Analysing the Data</h4>

<p>First download F1PerfView from either&nbsp;<a
href="http://rsdi.home.xs4all.nl/f1perfview.html">Rene Smit</a>'s
site or from&nbsp;<a
href="/media/22535/f1-telemetry.zip">here</a></p>

<p>Collecting this information isn't much use if there's no way to
display it.&nbsp; To my amazement, the tool to use is the same tool
as I used for Grand Prix 2 15 years ago.&nbsp; I found when I
downloaded the package from the author&nbsp;<a
href="http://rsdi.home.xs4all.nl/docs/f1perfview_doc.html">Rene
Smit</a>, it didn't have the MFC71.dll included and my machine
didn't have it.&nbsp; Figuring most all new machines wont have
this, I've included it in the above zip.&nbsp; It sits in the same
folder as F1PerfView.&nbsp; To run F1PerfView just extract it from
the zip and click on the F1PerfView.exe executable.</p>

<p>To analyse some captured laps, open the tool and
select&nbsp;<strong>Open&nbsp;</strong> from the menu. Change the
file type filter to be&nbsp;<strong>All Files
(*.*)</strong>&nbsp;and navigate to&nbsp;<strong>My
Documents\F1Speed\F1PerfView Data</strong>.</p>

<p>One you've unzipped F1PerfView you need to set the Primary
Game.&nbsp; To do this go to View -&gt; Options and set the
following</p>

<p><img src="/media/1772/f1perfview_options.png" width="500" height="305" alt="F1Perfview Options"/></p>

<p>Now to analyse two laps just go up to the Folder icon (the first
one) and select both laps</p>

<p><img src="/media/1767/f1perfview_loadboth.png" width="500" height="370" alt="F1Perfview LoadBoth"/></p>

<p>I like to display the Raw Lap data, the Circuit Map, and a graph
of Time Difference, and a graph of Speed, to start with.&nbsp; When
analysing I want at least the Time Diference open.</p>

<p>I've been on the lookout for a cockpit to hopefully improve my
times, but definitely improve my overall enjoyment.&nbsp; I toyed
with the idea of getting a model with an inbuilt seat but there's
both the high price and the size factor.&nbsp; I've got an L shaped
desk and I had just been clamping my G27 wheel and gear stick to
that, with the carpet providing some resistance to nearly hold my
pedals in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn't quite work though and often during a racing I'll be
trying to drag the pedals back to their optimal position, or worse
yet, trying to very quickly reattach my steering wheel to the desk
after I yanked it free in a hard bout of opposite lock.&nbsp; I
play a fair bit of games that use the H-shifter and I'd also like
to have it in a more natural position, down lower near my leg,
rather than on the same level as the wheel.</p>

 <img src="/media/1048/Next_Level_Wheel_Stand_with_G27.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Next Level Wheel Stand" style="float: left;"/>My solution to this problem, given all the
parameters, was the Next Level Racing Wheel, a sturdy frame that
provides mounting points to screw in a G27 kit, wheel, pedals and
shifters.</p>

<p>The package arrived via rather large cardboard box, almost fully
assembled.&nbsp; The out of the box experience was great and the
frame was of high quality solid construction with an attractive
pearl black enamel finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only work on my part was fixing the gear shift lever on my
preferred side (left) and then attaching the G27 components using
the supplied allen key screws.&nbsp; All hole lined up perfectly
and all screws went in with minimum of fuss, a positive sign of a
quality build process.&nbsp; Another bonus, which I found
thoughtful, was the inclusion of four velcro strips which I used to
tuck the various cables of my G27 into the frame.&nbsp; After about
15 minutes of assembly I was plugged in and doing laps in my
favourite racing simulator.</p>

<p>The first few minutes of driving were spent adjusting the
pedals, sliding them further back, and raising the height of the
wheel, which also raises the height of the gearshift.&nbsp; The
wheel height extension arms have holes at regular intervals into
which you can screw a bolt, but I found it possible to still have a
sturdy setup with the screws firmly screwed in against the
metal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few laps of hard driving later and I was impressed. The entire
structure is solidly planted to the ground, a combination of the
weight of the unit and rubber feet preventing movement on my carpet
floored 'study'.&nbsp; I was also able to be very aggressive with
all of the pedals, gearshift, and wheel without them moving; the
hand screw adjustable pedal base remaining locked.</p>

<p>When I'm not playing racing games I simply unplug the USB cable
from my PC and drag the frame off of the side. It also folds up
vertically so it can be stored in a cupboard (or under a bed?), for
those people who have their PC's in a more open space or use it for
a wheel on a console plugged in to their lounge room
television.</p>

<p>Overall I give the unit 4.5/5 and I've got no complaints with
what was supplied.&nbsp; If I could do anything to improve the
package it would be to provide a way to secure the wheels on my
chair to the frame, at a positioning of my choosing.&nbsp; This
would ensure a perfect driving position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bluetape">Rating: 4.5/5</p>

<p><img src="/media/1807/gears.jpg" width="300" height="241" alt="gears" style="float: right;"/></p>

<p>The old theory for gear ratio selection went something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick the ratio for your top gear by aiming to hit the rev
limiter when about to brake first the first corner immediately
following the longest straight.</li>

<li>Pick the ratio for your first gear that will maximise your
start line getaway.</li>

<li>Distribute your other gears evenly between first and
seventh</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are however other factors to consider. Sebastian Vettel
showed us at the recent 2011 Italian GP at Monza that top speed is
less critical to success. The commentators made a point of
expressing how Vettel had gone with a different set of gear ratios
than traditionally would be selected, and than what the majority
the other competitors selected.</p>

<p>First gear is important because positions are hard to come by
and it's easiest to make up positions when the cars are closest
together. This is obviously at the start. To increase torque and
reduce wheelspin a high first gear is desired. spacing 2nd through
6th evenly toward 7th isn't the correct way to go though.</p>

<p>In most cases you can consider 1st gear as&nbsp;<em>the starting
gear</em>&nbsp;and then ignore it altogether. Gear 2nd gear
significantly lower than 1st, so that off the line there's maximum
torque, but once second gear is engaged, there's maximum power and
you're in the upper rev range before quickly shifting to 3rd.</p>

<p>Gears should be selected based on the circuit and the ratios
should be kept close together and correctly selected to leave the
engine in the best power generating rev range. You can short shift
where extra traction is required.</p>

<p>Ideally 1st and 7th should be two taller bookends either side of
your ratios, with 2nd through 6th closely together. Having a much
tighter gearbox should provide better corner speed and as Sebastian
Vettel provide, a faster lap time.</p>

<p>F1Speed is an&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.nessoft.com/ispeed/">iSpeed</a>&nbsp;clone for
Codemasters F1 series games.</p>

<p>F1Speed is intended to run side-by-side with Codemasters F1
series games to display data useful for giving instant feedback on
setup changes and changes to driving style, such as braking points,
throttle on points and apexes.&nbsp; It's useful also to analyse
the effect of KERS usage at difference points of the track and can
easily highlight where you're the weaker during your lap.</p>

<h3>Quick Links</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="#install">Get the installer</a></li>

<li><a href="#revisions">Change list (Version change
history)</a></li>

<li><a href="#testtool">Connection Tester (if you're having
troubles connecting to F1 2012 to F1Speed)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>F1Speed functionality</h3>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Instant Speed Delta to comparison lap</li>

<li>Time delta to comparison lap</li>

<li>Comparison (Fastest or Reference) Lap time</li>

<li>Current Lap time</li>

<li>Wheelspin indicators</li>

<li>Save and load fastest lap for each track and session type
(types are: Qualifying, Race, Practice, Time Trial, On-line
Qualifying, On-line Race).</li>

<li>Load reference lap (f1s format)</li>

<li>Save fastest lap (f1s format)</li>

<li>Capture F1PerfView data for analysis.</li>

<li>Export Fastest Lap to F1PerfView (csv format)</li>
</ul>

<p>The delta is taken between your fastest lap and your current
lap.&nbsp; As such, F1Speed will not show delta's until you start
your second&nbsp;<strong>complete</strong>&nbsp;lap.</p>

<p>A green Speed Delta indicates your current car speed is greater
than your car speed at that point of your fastest lap. Red
indicates that you car speed is currently less.&nbsp; This is also
indicated by '+' and '-'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Time delta at the bottom of the screen shows the difference
in lap time between your current lap and your fastest lap.&nbsp;
Green means your current lap is faster than that your fastest at
this point in time, as does a positive time. Red means you're
slower, as does a negative time.&nbsp; The bar will grow from the
center as your current lap time gets further from your current
fastest lap.</p>

<p>The maximum time granularity of the bar is +/- 2.0 seconds from
your fastest lap.&nbsp; Once your time exceeds that limit the bar
will not move, although the time delta numeric display will
continue to update.&nbsp; Once your time drops below the limit the
bar will again continue to move.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1702/f1speed_0.5_600x310.jpg" width="500" height="260" alt="F1Speed Main"/></p>

<p>Before you go out and start setting times you need to set your
circuit and session type. Once you've done this and set a fastest
lap, that lap time will be loaded each time you select that circuit
and session combination.</p>

<p>F1Speed also shows three times on the right hand side.</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Fastest Lap&nbsp;</strong> displays the fastest lap you
have ever set at this circuit / type combination.</li>

<li><strong>Average Lap</strong>&nbsp;shows the average lap time
for all laps performed in this session.</li>

<li><strong>Current Lap</strong>&nbsp;shows the lap time of your
current lap. This will match the lap time shown in game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Features</h3>

<p><strong>Import Reference Lap<br />
</strong> Importing a reference lap allows you to import a lap time
from a previously exported f1speed file.&nbsp; This allows you to
save your fastest lap and share it with your friends or post it on
your league forum for others to compare against.&nbsp; Importing a
reference lap switch F1Speed to "Reference Lap" mode, as seen by
the text changing from "Fastest Lap" to "Reference Lap".&nbsp; In
reference lap mode your fastest lap time is still saved if you
happen to set a fastest lap while in reference mode, but you cannot
see it until you switch back to "Fastest Lap" mode.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Reference Lap<br />
</strong> This menu item allows you to clear the previously
imported reference lap and revert back to "Fastest Lap" mode, where
your fastest lap is loaded and that is the time against which your
current lap is compared.</p>

<p><strong>Export Fastest Lap<br />
</strong> Save your current fastest lap to file so it can be
imported later.<strong><br />
</strong></p>

<p><strong>F1PerfView files</strong><br />
 All files are stored in&nbsp;<strong>My
Documents\F1Speed</strong>.&nbsp;
The&nbsp;<strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;folder contains fastest laps
and the&nbsp;<strong>F1PerfView Data</strong>&nbsp;folder contains
files that can be read by F1PerfView (csv format).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>F1Speed needs .NET 4.0 installed.&nbsp; .NET 4.0 is a
recommended update for Vista and Windows 7 so hopefully most people
have it installed, if not you can download the 30MB .NET 4.0 client
profile.&nbsp; When you click on the Install button below you be
asked to download setup.exe which will launch the bootstrapper and
install the rest of the application from the web. It's tiny, so
doens't take long and because it's a ClickOnce app it'll notify you
whenever it's updated!</p>

<p>The most important step is to configure the link between F1
2012/2011/2010 and F1Speed.&nbsp; F1 2011 publishes telemetry data
via UDP and we need to tell F1 2012/2011/2010 to use F1Speed as the
telemetry destination. To do this you need to change your
files.</p>

<p>To do this first ensure F1 2012/2011/2010 is closed, and
then&nbsp;open the file "hardware_settings_config.xml". This is
found in your&nbsp;<strong>My Documents</strong>&nbsp;folder in the
subpath<strong>./My
Games/FormulaOne2011/hardwaresettings/</strong>.</p>

<p>Open the file in your favourite text editor and change the
line</p>

<p><img src="/media/1837/old_telem_setting.png" width="500" height="20" alt="old telem setting f1 2011"/></p>

<p>to be</p>

<p><img src="/media/1832/new_telem_setting.png" width="500" height="15" alt="new telem setting f1 2011"/></p>

<p><em>Just to be clear, use a&nbsp;<strong>text
editor</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>notepad</strong>.
&nbsp;Don't open the file in something like word and try and
convert it around. &nbsp;It'll only lead to tears (as a few guys
have found out).</em></p>

<p>Once this change has been made be sure to mark the file
as&nbsp;<strong>'read-only'</strong>&nbsp;or F1 2012/2011/2010 will
overwrite your changes. Marking the file as readonly will not
effect the game in any way.</p>

<h3>Running on another computer</h3>

<p>Not everyone has a multiple monitor setup.&nbsp; You can run
F1Speed on another windows based (or Linux running Mono!) PC by
changing the ip value in
the&nbsp;<strong>&lt;motion&gt;&nbsp;</strong> element above to be
the ip of the pc that will run F1Speed.&nbsp; The only hurdle you
may come up against is firewalls.&nbsp; You can check by running
telnet from your F1 2012/2011/2010 machine to the pc hosting
F1Speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For version 0.5.5 and above you'll need to go to options and
enable connections from other computers by ticking "F1 2011 runs on
another PC"</p>

<p><img src="/media/1782/f1speed_options.png" width="372" height="287" alt="F1speed Options"/></p>

<p><em>Important: Versions of F1Speed prior to 0.5.3 do not work on
other computers.&nbsp; I guess I should have actually tested it
before just going 'yeh it'll work!' - This nerd had set the UDP
listener to only receive from localhost.</em></p>

<p>You'll need to set an outgoing firewall rule on your F1
2012/2011/2010 machine. Open Windows Firewall (type "Windows
Firewall with Advanced Security" in your Start Menu and then click
on it).&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>On the left hand side click "Outbound Rules"</li>

<li>On the right hand side click "New Rule..."</li>

<li>Select "Port. Rule that controls connection for TCP or UDP
port" and then click Next</li>

<li>Select UDP and Specific local ports, then enter 20777 in the
text box. click Next</li>

<li>Click Allow the connection. click Next</li>

<li>Check only "Private" for "Where does this rule apply". click
Next</li>

<li>Name it "F1Speed" and click Finish</li>

<li>Repeat on your pc that will run F1Speed but this time creating
an "Inbound Rule"</li>
</ol>

<p>Or follow the steps for your installed firewall software.</p>

<p><a id="install" name="install"></a><a
href="/f1speed/f1speed.application">Install</a></p>

<p>Once the ClickOnce install has completed, there will be an
F1Speed icon in your start menu.&nbsp; Don't forget to set the ip
address in the motion element, as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="display: none;">
<h3>Connection Tester</h3>

<p>I've created a connection tester for those having troubles
connecting to F1Speed from F1 2012. &nbsp;This small app will
attempt a UDP connection to F1Speed on the same port as if it were
F1 2012. &nbsp;If successful, F1Speed's connection light (top right
hand corner of the app) will flash green, the same as it does when
F1 2012 is connected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The connection tester sends data to F1Speed that simulates the
car sitting in the garage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tester comes in a zip file. &nbsp;To use, download the zip
and unblock, by right clicking on the zip, selecting properties,
then unblock (on the General tab). Then unzip to location of your
choice and click "Send To F1Speed". By default the app looks for
F1Speed on your local machine but you can enter a different addres
to test the connection to a remote machine - useful if you're
running F1Speed on your laptop.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1752/clubsport_pedals.jpg" width="255" height="198" alt="Clubsport Pedals" style="float: right;"/>When it comes to
controllers for racing games/sims, many people forget about the
importance of the pedal set.&nbsp; Much attention is given to the
quality of the wheel, whether or not it has force feedback and if
it does, how good it is.&nbsp; A good pedal set however can not
only add to the realistic feel of the game but can also decrease
lap times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Fanatec Clubsport Pedals are the top of the Fanatec pile
with fully adjustable clutch, brake, and accelarator pedal
positioning, including the must for any real racing sim fan: a load
cell on the brake.&nbsp; Use of a load cell allows the driver to
use muscle memory rather than positional memory used
when&nbsp;operating cheaper potentiometer pedals such as found on
the Logitech G27.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pedals themselves also feel fantastic on bare feet. The
drilled aluminium foot pads on each of the clutch and brake pedal
are very comfortable on the feet and the default position of the
pedals makes heel-toe braking (if you want to feel more pro!) much
easier than the G27 set.</p>

<p>Each pedal also comes with more discrete values (1024) than the
Logitech G27/G25 pedals (256).&nbsp; I immediately noticed that
slides and power oversteer was easier control with this pedal set
and I think that's down to the larger range offerred by these
pedals. That's nearly invaluable in a game like iRacing, with
realist physics and where many of the cars are going much slower,
giving more opportunity for mortals like me to react and correct a
tail happy car.&nbsp; I didn't notice any benefit in F1 2011, but
spins there tend to happen much faster; or perhaps it's not so
realistic - and it's true I don't lose the back as often.&nbsp;
It's not just useful in helping you get out of trouble; a more
accurate accelerator will help you stay out of trouble by giving
more precise input into corners and hopefully reducing oversteer
moments.</p>

<p><span class="quote">It is&nbsp;uniformily agreed amongst serious
racers (as found on iRacing) that load cell technology has enabled
them to decrease braking distances, allowing for easier and safer
overtakes, as well as faster lap times.</span>The load cell also
more closely mimics the feel of a real brake pedal, giving the
driver a more realistic racing experience.&nbsp; The Clubsport's
load cell is adjustable, allowing the driver to change the firmness
(pressure) required by the brake.&nbsp; At it's hardest setting not
even my considerable quad and calf muscles can provide enough force
to consistently reach maximum braking force.&nbsp; At the hardest
setting I have to really&nbsp;<strong>stomp</strong>&nbsp;hard,
from a distance, to reach any more than 40%, making fine
application of the brakes difficult.&nbsp; At it's lowest seetting
the pedal feels more like what is found on the G27, although still
significantly better.&nbsp; Not a lot of force is required to reach
maximum braking.&nbsp; My preference is at about 30%.&nbsp; At that
level I can consistently reach maximum braking force yet still
remain able to gently apply the brakes mid corner to keep the car
balanced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another feature of the Clubsport brake pedal is force-feedback.
Unfortunately it's a bit of a lost cause, as no games support it
officially. There are however third party addons for various games
(iRacing is one) that provide an accurate mimic.</p>

<p>I purchased my Clubsport set as an upgrade to my existing G27
pedals, and to that end they worked flawlessly.&nbsp; The Clubsport
set is plugged into my PC via USB and is detected as a second
controller.&nbsp; Most modern racing games recognise multiple
controllers at once (eg iRacing and F1 2011) and it'll work
straight out of the box.&nbsp; The biggest disappointment was
mounting the set to my&nbsp;<a href="/{localLink:1685}"
title="Next Level Wheel Stand Review">Next Level Racing Stand</a>.
The hole didn't line up with what where pre-drilled and the unit is
too wide to drill in more holes.&nbsp; As it turns out, a few
months down the track, I didn't need to screw/bolt it on.&nbsp; The
thing doesn't move, not even with the firmest braking force.</p>

<p>One small problem I had experienced only 1 week after purchase
was the accelarator was getting stuck at varying degrees of
open.&nbsp; I read this is caused by dust and debris getting caught
in the fine cogs that sense movement.&nbsp; I blew in that area and
the pedals worked fine.&nbsp; It happened a few times in that week
but hasn't happened at all in the few months since (Perhaps I just
needed to clean under my desk ;)).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It did take me a few weeks to get used to the feeling of the
pedals, but now I have, there's no way&nbsp;I would willing go back
to a potentiometer setup.</p>

<p>When it comes to controllers for racing games/sims, many people
forget about the importance of the pedal set. &nbsp;Much attention
is given to the quality of the wheel, whether or not it has force
feedback and if it does, how good it is. &nbsp;A good pedal set
however can not only add to the realistic feel of the game but can
also decrease lap times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cars tires provide the interface between the power produced by
the engine, the downforce produced by the aerodynamics, the grip
produced by the springs, roll bars and other suspension components
and the road surface. &nbsp;In this role, tires play the most
important factor in car performance. &nbsp;Without tires a car
would go nowhere.</p>

<p>That said, there are no tire setup options with in Codemasters
F1 series other than the type of tyre that can be fitted to a car:
Option, Prime, Intermediate, Wet. Tires do degrade while driving
though.</p>

<p><strong>What causes a tire to lose performance?</strong></p>

<p>A tires' performance is lost as rubber is worn off during the
course of a race. &nbsp;You may think that higher grip situations
would result in higher tire wear. &nbsp;The tire is giving more
performance by way of grip, so surely it must do so at the cost of
life? &nbsp;This isn't case however. &nbsp;A tire is degrades
faster in low grip situations where the wheels are slipping over
the surface of the track. &nbsp;The tire has to work harder to get
traction as well as it's moving across the road faster than it
otherwise would, in the absence of wheelspin. &nbsp;If you're
getting 10% wheelspin over 30 meters of corner exit, your tire has
just done 33 meters.</p>

<p><strong>How can wheelspin be reduced?</strong></p>

<p>Wheelspin is caused by a lack of grip (see&nbsp;<a
href="/{localLink:1313}"
title="What is grip in and how is it generated on an F1 car">what
is grip and how it is generated</a>). &nbsp;Grip is produced by
either aerodynamical or mechanical means, or more typically both.
&nbsp;Applying more grip will produce a more driveable car.</p>

<p>Wheelspin is also reduced by being more sensitive with throttle
and brake inputs. &nbsp;Rather than instantly pushing the
accelerator to the floor, gently squeeze the throttle. &nbsp;This
will give you more grip, and while it may not feel as fast, it
generally is faster than rapidly applying the throttle. &nbsp;It
will also save you fuel. &nbsp;More gentle braking can also save
the life of the tire by reduce the chance of locking a wheel into a
turn and generating a flat spot, the opposite of wheel spin, where
the tyre is not moving as fast (it's not moving at all!) as the car
is across the surface of the track.</p>

<p>Generally, a higher downforce setting will yield reduced tire
wear. &nbsp;You can also adjust the gearing to give more traction,
which will help eliminate wheelspin. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Try various setups and driving styles as analyse the effect with
F1PerfView, recoding your lap with&nbsp;<a href="/{localLink:2104}"

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>It's hard to imagine that anything performed while seated is
physically taxing, and yet, Formula One is one of the most
physically demanding sports a competitor can undertake. While it's
true that at a base level drivers are seated inside a car, it's the
intense physicality of the sport, the g-forces exerted on the body
during acceleration, deceleration, and corning that begin to make
it difficult for drivers. Pulling 4g's through a corner makes the
drivers weight increase by a factor of 4, so a 10kg head suddenly
weighs 40 kilos and the neck must be able to support that
strain.</p>

<p>Formula 1 is a sport where success is measured in the
thousandths of a second and maximum concentration must be applied
to an entire qualifying and race effort, with races up to two hours
in duration. The effects of the tight confines of the cockpit, the
high temperatures of the track and car, and the gforces exerted on
the body all work together to drain the body, through sustain high
levels of physical exertion. Once the body starts to fatigue,
concentration starts to be effected and lap times can increase, or
worse, the driver can have an accident.</p>

<p>Besides the physical effects of motor racing on the body, the
act of concentrating itself can increase stresses on the body and
increase fatigue, effecting concentration.</p>

<p>While we only compete in a virtual environment with force
feedback wheels, and the few of us with more expensive additions,
we're all still subjected to high levels of sustained concentration
and elevated stress levels, as the pressure of having to perform at
100% manifests during qualifying and the race, particularly the
start.</p>

<p>During the Season 4 Germany Grand Prix in my league I strapped a
heart rate monitor to better understand just what virtual racers,
and to a tiny extent, racing drivers themselves, undergo as they
battle for a win.</p>

<p>The following graph is the recording of two qualifying sessions
and a 50% full distance race of the Nurburgring circuit in
Codemasters F1 2011. During this event I was one of the favourites
to win the race, my first win of the season, and had plenty of my
own high expectations, also increasing my stress levels. I started
from pole position and on the first corner was tagged and then on
the second last corner of the first lap was tagged again, this time
relegating me to ninth place, requiring a strategic rise up the
grid if he was to recoup even some of the potential points haul I
was expecting. This strategy saw me save fuel during the early
stages of the race, with the intent of focussing 100% on a series
of 'qualifying' style laps at the end of the race, when fuel loads
would be light and the stickier Option tyres fresh.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1817/heartrate.png" width="500" height="180" alt="racing heartrate graph"/></p>

<p>My typical seated heart rate is about 72 beats per minute.
Already the anticipation of racing had my heart rate elevated to
over 100 beats per minute.</p>

<p>There are 4 marked segments of this graph where the drivers
heart rate spiked and interesting these spike events all map
directly to a typical period of high stress during the race.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Qualifying Session 1</strong> - Dry running. I tried an
alternate strategy in stint one, on the slower prime tyres, before
coming back out for another run on sticky option tyres.</li>

<li><strong>Qualifying Session 2</strong> - Wet Weather session
where I set pole position in one run then waited in the garage for
the other drivers to complete their laps. An initial dramatic rise
in heart rate was evident during my focussed qualifying run, with
the heart rate dropping once I sat in the pits.</li>

<li><strong>Race start</strong> - Suffered two hits on the first
lap which knocked me back to 9<sup>th</sup>place and only a few
seconds from last.</li>

<li><strong>Final stint</strong> on Option tyres and Rich fuel,
catching the cars in front at seconds per lap and ultimately
finishing in 3<sup>rd</sup> position, less than 10 seconds from
2<sup>nd</sup>place.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's evident in this graph that it's not just the physical
demands of racing that take their toll on race drivers. The mental
aspect and the stress of the sport itself also plays a significant
part.</p>

<p>A future study could be conducted using stress inhibitors such
as alcohol to see if that both lowers heart rate and increases
performance. It's possible, even likely, that increased heart rate
and stress level help to improve reflexes, reaction times, and
ultimately lap times.</p>

<p>Being fast at Codemasters F1 series, like any simulation racing
game, is all about understanding grip, what it is and how it's
generated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its essence grip is the&nbsp;<em>tyre's friction co-efficient
x weight</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two aspects to grip:</p>

<ul class="ticks">
<li>Mechanical</li>

<li>Aerodynamic</li>
</ul>

<p>The mechanical aspect controls the left side of the above
equation, the friction co-efficient of the tyre, while the weight
is controlled by aerodynamics.</p>

<p>Aerodynamics are used to control downforce, which is a downward
pressure on the car increasing its&nbsp;weight&nbsp;and thus it's
grip levels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mechanical Grip</h3>

<p>Mechanical Grip is optimised by ensuring the tyre is maintaining
maximum contact with the road at all times.&nbsp; This contact does
not include slipping.&nbsp; If you're wheels are spinning, your
tyres have broken contact with the ground, the&nbsp;friction
co-efficient&nbsp;is basically 0 and no matter how much weight you
have, you're grip is nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The easiest way to think about it is Mechanical Grip is
controlled by what's underneath the car, and Aerodynamic Grip is
controlled by what's on top, now that we don't have ground-effect
cars, and although the rear-diffuser is hugely important, it is not
adjustable in F1 2011.&nbsp; Mechanical grip is controlled by
springs, anti-roll bars, and camber and caster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Aerodynamic Grip</h3>

<p>Aerodynamic grip is all important at high speed tracks, tracks
with fast sweeping turns and smooth surfaces, like
Spa-francorchamps or Catalunya.&nbsp; Mechincal Grip is king at
slow tracks such as Monaco and also you to get better drive out of
slow speed corners.&nbsp; At a track like Monaco, Aerodynamic Grip
is next to useless and at a track like Catalunya, Mechanical Grip
plays a tiny part on lap pace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aerodynamic grip is
controlled by the front and rear wings and the gap between the road
and the bottom of the car, which also factors in the wing settings
pushing the car down, the ride height and the spring
stiffness.&nbsp; Soft springs will mean make the aerodynamic
downforce push the car down more than hard springs.&nbsp; The
correct ride height needs to take this into consideration.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Assuming you've&nbsp;<a href="/%7BlocalLink:1751%7D"
title="Using Telemetry with F1 2011: Getting started">installed and
set up telemetry</a>&nbsp;for F1 2012, you're probably wanting to
know how to interpret the data it produces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guys at&nbsp;<a
href="http://lapfaster.com">lapfaster.com</a>&nbsp;have written a
fantastic ebook on this topic and while it's not tailored
specifically for the telemetry used by F1 2012, all the principles
and theories it teaches apply.</p>

<p><a href="/media/28181/data_logger_secrets_revealed.pdf"
class="button">Download Here</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Using telemetry to get faster</h4>

<p>Now you've captured a few laps using F1Speed, it's time to apply
the knowledge you absorbed from reading the lapfaster.com guide to
F1PerfView.&nbsp; First load two laps into F1PerfView (click the
link at the top of this article to see how).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The single most important graph is Time Difference.&nbsp; This
graph shows you where one lap is losing time relative to the
other.&nbsp; Quickly observe the graph and pick the place where it
rises the fastest. This is where you're losing the most time and is
the best place to make your initial changes.</p>

<p>I've circled in yellow my two big slow points.&nbsp; The light
blue lap is 1:25.919 and the red lap is the slower, 1:27.604</p>

<p><img src="/media/1827/initialslowpoints.jpg" alt="Initial slow points"/></p>

<p>To more easily see what's going on at that point in time, I'm
going to zoom in on my first slow point.&nbsp; To do this, I hold
my left mouse button down and drag it so I've selected everything
within the first yellow circle, then I hit the Enter key (or right
click and select&nbsp;<em>Zoom Selection</em>).&nbsp; Make sure to
select enough to capture the full corner, just before you start
braking all the way to after you've hit your track out.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1757/f1perfview_analysis1.jpg" alt="F1Perfview Analysis1"/></p>

<p>From the above you can see the following in relation to the
faster lap:</p>

<ul>
<li>I braked earlier and less heavy (Braking over distance).</li>

<li>I got off the throttle earlier, inline with my braking
earlier.&nbsp; I got on the throttle earlier.</li>

<li>My exit speed was higher as&nbsp; result of getting on the
throttle earlier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on those quick observations I can see the only reason my
time was faster in that corner was because I got on the throttle
earlier, if you look at the Time delta again you can see I was
acually losing time to my slower lap until that point.&nbsp;
Zooming in on that sector make it more apparent.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1762/f1perfview_analysis2.jpg" alt="F1Perfview Analysis2"/></p>

<p>My&nbsp;<strong>speed over distance</strong>&nbsp;(bottom right)
and&nbsp;<strong>throttle over distance&nbsp;</strong> (top right)
show my speed was consistently higher through that part of the
lap.&nbsp; Once the corner was over the time difference didn't
change again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tip: You can use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out on the
grids.&nbsp; They synchronise zoom level. If you also show the
Track View you can see where on the track your current data
relates.&nbsp; You can also see the different lines you took.<br />
</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Application</h4>

<p>You may want to investigate other graphs to try and determine
why your speeds are slower, but for now it's probably best to just
hit the track and try applying the brake and throttle at different
points, as indicated by the graph.</p>

<p>Fire up F1 2012 again and take to the track, capturing more data
for analysis to see if it made a difference. This is where F1Speed
really comes into it's own. Without having to switch back to
F1PerfView you can use the time delta bar to see if your changes in
driving style have impacted on lap time in the manner you
expect.</p>

<p>F1 201x car setups are variable. The ranges you have to play
with are determined by the track you are on.&nbsp; This means two
main points.&nbsp; It's probably perfectly acceptable to run the
same setup on nearly every track, as while the values on screen
stay the same, their real world values change to suit the track,
thus it's more like having the setup reflect an overall driving
style.&nbsp; The other point is that it's confusing to people who
are well versed with car setup in other games and real life, where
setup is not track dependant. They run the risk of setting small
differences which have no effect in the game.&nbsp; For example a
front wing value of 1 does not produce the same downforce at Monza
as it does at Monaco.&nbsp; I made this mistake initially in my
setup.&nbsp; I went out with small differences between ride height
and front and rear wings, thinking I don't want to go to big or the
car would be too biased in one direction, only to find the setup
changes of a few notches of front wing made no discernable
difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Aerodynamics</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1732/aerodynamics.jpg" width="250" height="135" alt="F12011 Aero" style="float: left;"/>&nbsp;Aero is king in Formula One.&nbsp; A cars lap
speed is mostly influenced by it's aerodynamic setup.&nbsp; There
are three main components to aerodynamics on a Formula One car and
the game only makes two obvious.&nbsp; Front and Rear wing settings
can be found on the Aerodynamics page of car setup and these values
control the amount of downforce generated at the front and rear of
the car.</p>

<p>Wings should be the first and most important thing tweaked on a
car setup.&nbsp; It's easiest to think about wings like this: Front
wing determines how fast you can go round corners; how much
understeer your car generates.&nbsp; Rear wing determines how fast
you can go down the straight as well as how much oversteer you get
during cornering.&nbsp; Wing settings also influence braking
distance.&nbsp; A higher wing setting means the car is more stable
under brakes and will stop faster.</p>

<p>Formula 1 cars also use the undertray (bottom) of the car to
generate downforce, by channelling airflow through particular
points. For this to work effectively, the car needs to be the right
distance from the ground.&nbsp; A general rule is the lower the car
can run, the faster it will go. Think of it like the lower a car is
to the ground, the easier it is for the car to be sucked to the
road.</p>

<div>
<h4>Mainly Influences:</h4>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Top Speed</li>

<li>Front wing influences corner entry</li>

<li>Rear wing influences mid corner</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Braking</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1747/braking.jpg" width="249" height="135" alt="F12011 Braking" style="float: left;"/>&nbsp;Brake balance influences stopping distance
and how your car enters a corner (especially when trail
braking).&nbsp; As a cars brakes are applied, the weight of the car
moves forward, thus in general front biased brake balance should
help a car stop more quickly.&nbsp; On a road car this is managed
by putting larger brake discs on the front than back.&nbsp; Brake
balance can also play a part in when and how often your wheels lock
during braking.&nbsp; Locking wheels are bad.&nbsp; When wheels are
locked, they're sliding over the top of the road and are no longer
slowing the car down (as they're sliding, they're not griping the
road).&nbsp; Locked wheels also cause flat-spots, which make the
tyre resemble a 50 cent piece and make the car harder to
drive.&nbsp; An approach I take to setting brake balance is to
first determine the corner where braking is most critical to lap
time and then set my brakes up to work best for that corner.</p>

<p>Brake pressure effects how easily your brakes lock.&nbsp; A
higher pressure will make it easier to lock the brakes but it will
also make the car stop faster. It's a trade-off and depends on
brake balance also.</p>

<p>Brake size determines how long your brakes work effectively
during the race.&nbsp; On high force braking tracks like Canada and
Monza, large brakes will mean you'll have more effective brakes at
the end of the race. The trade-off is more size = more weight, so
your car will be heavier and slightly slower.</p>

<p>If your front wheels are locking under braking you have too much
front brake bias.&nbsp; If your car is "squirming" around under
brakes, you have too much rear brake bias.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Mainly Influences</strong>:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Stopping distance</li>

<li>Car handling on corner entry</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Balance</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1742/balance.jpg" width="249" height="135" alt="F12011 Balance" style="float: left;"/>ARBs,
or anti-roll bars reduce the amount of lateral roll through
corners.&nbsp; The higher the value, the lower body roll.&nbsp; It
is also used to control levels of understeer and oversteer.&nbsp; A
bias toward the front tends the car to understeer and bias toward
rear will tend the car towards oversteer.&nbsp; Configuring the
ARBs to be too stiff all round will cause the inside wheels to lift
off the ground when cornering and this will reduce grip and
traction.</p>

<p>ARB's also work in tandem with springs (see below) to stiff the
car, so spring settings must also be considered when ARB's are
adjusted.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Mainly Influences:</strong></p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Car handling on corner entry</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Suspension</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1887/suspension.jpg" width="250" height="136" alt="f12011 suspension" style="float: left;"/>&nbsp;As mentioned in the aerodynamics section,
ride height determines the amount of downforce generated by the
undertray of the car and comprises as much as 40% of the total
downforce of an F1 car.&nbsp; That's too huge a number to be
ignored.&nbsp; Ride height also affects the ability of the car to
ride kerbs or bumps in the track.&nbsp; Too low a ride height will
cause the car to bottom out over bumps.&nbsp; Once a car bottoms
out the downforce generated by the undertray becomes zero (as
effectively the airflow is cut and
stalled).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ride height can also be used to help influence car balance by
way of weight transfer.&nbsp; This is performed by raising one end
of the car higher than the other, pushing the centre of gravity
either forward or back.&nbsp; As with ballast, a raised front will
shift weight rearward and reduce front end grip, tending the car to
understeer, while a relative raised rear will help cure understeer
and tend the car to oversteer.</p>

<p>Springs have a few functions.&nbsp; A soft setting allows the
tyre to maintain contact with the road over bumps, providing more
traction and grip.&nbsp; Soft springs also mean you have to run a
higher ride height.&nbsp; Downforce increases exponentially with
speed, so the faster you go the more downforce you generate.&nbsp;
Downforce pushes the car down effect ride height.&nbsp; Thus if you
run soft springs on a fast circuit you run the risk of bottoming
out on fast corners and losing control.&nbsp; Springs also effect
body roll (as mentioned in balance and anti-roll bars) and help
tune understeer/oversteer.</p>

<h4>Mainly Influences:</h4>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Ride height impacts mid-corner stability</li>

<li>Corner entry (softer front springs to reduce understeer or
harder rear springs)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Gearbox</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1802/gearbox.jpg" width="250" height="135" alt="F12011 Gearbox" style="float: left;"/>&nbsp;The typical recommendation is to select the
1st gear ratio that will propel you off the line the fastest and
select the 7th gear ration that will cause your engine to hit the
rev limit just before the braking point of the fastest part of the
circuit.</p>

<p>But what do you do in between?&nbsp; You can either space the
gears evenly from 1st through to 7th or you can bias low gearing
and have a long 7th gear, or vice-versus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>F1 2010 is confusing in that I would expect if you set all the
gear markers in a line, you would be at the same speed in all gears
(have the same ratio/number of teeth).&nbsp; However that's not the
case.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can clearly see that all in a line (the
default) results in different top speeds in each gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also think about traction when you consider gear ratios. A
higher ratio will result on more traction but not accelerate as
hard. What this means it that in some corners it's better to have
more traction than wheel spin, so the end result is greater
acceleration; while in others, wheel-spin doesn't come into it, so
purely a lower gear ratio is better.</p>

<p>My preference is to set the car up with a high 1st gear, giving
my good traction and a much lower 2nd through 6th gear, very
closely spaced.&nbsp; My 7th gear is generally high, so I get good
top end speed and good acceleration through the corners.&nbsp; The
only downside is I'm susceptible to overtakes when I'm in 7th gear
a pulling low revs.</p>

<p><strong>Mainly Influences:</strong></p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Top Speed</li>

<li>Traction out of corners</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>

<p><img src="/media/1737/alignment.jpg" width="250" height="135" alt="F12011 Align" style="float: left;"/>&nbsp;Camber refers to the angle your wheels make
with the ground.&nbsp; A highly camber tyre means the tyre leans
either in or out from the car.&nbsp; F1 2010 does negative cambers
only (a sensible idea) which means the tyre leans in toward the car
at the top.&nbsp; A larger negative camber increases the ability to
turn the car (reduces oversteer).&nbsp; This is because when the
cornering forces are exerted on the tyre, the tyre deforms and more
contact patch is on the road, offering up more grip.</p>

<p>The flipside of negative camber is that when you accelerate in a
straight line you have less tyre on the road and therefore less
grip and either can't accelerate as hard or get snap oversteer on
corner exit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A high speed track like Monza would require little negative
camber compared to a circuit like Monaco.</p>

<p>Toe operates on the other plane to Camber.&nbsp; That is, Toe-in
means the front of the tyre is closer to the vehicle than the rear
of the tyre.&nbsp; F1 2010 always deals with Toe-in.&nbsp; More
Toe-in causes more straight line stability at the cost of turn in
response.</p>

<p>How does camber interact with toe?&nbsp; When a wheel is
cambered, the interaction between the tyre and the road surface
causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were
part of a conical surface.&nbsp; This tendency to turn increases
the rolling resistance and tyre wear. A small amount of toe-out
will counter the effect of negative camber on rolling
resistance.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Mainly Influences:</strong></p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Rear toe-in effects car handling on corner exit</li>

<li>Front toe-in effects ability to turn into corner</li>
</ul>

<p>Driving in the rain can be a treacherous experience but finding
the right wet weather setup can help make it a lot less
hazardous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wet weather car setups are all about maximising grip, both
mechanical and aero.&nbsp; You want the highest wing settings and
the softest springs you can run while maintaining your car
balance.&nbsp; Ride height is critical here too, but in the
opposite direction of a dry weather setup.&nbsp; Too little ground
clearance and the bottom of your car is splashing through
puddles.&nbsp; Also, very soft spring settings makes a low ride
height not very good.</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Increase front and rear wings by at least 2 clicks (if
possible)</li>

<li>Reduce brake pressure and size of discs</li>

<li>Increase gear ratios (move to right)</li>

<li>Soften roll bars and springs</li>

<li>Raise ride height</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically you want to set your front and rear wings to 11 and
raise your ride height to 11 front and rear.&nbsp; Also run the
lowest braking pressure, to avoid lockups.&nbsp; You can also save
some weight by reducing the size of the brake ducts.&nbsp; Because
it's raining and likely cooler, you don't need them so large.
You're also not generating as much heat in your brakes becuase you
cannot brake as hard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most crucial to a driveable car is gear
ratios.&nbsp; Here you can either use the same gear ratios as in
the dry, but short shift, or you can select really long ratios and
minimise torque and therefore wheelspin.&nbsp; My preference is to
go long gear ratios because I like to see all the pretty lights on
my wheel and it saves some effort in paying so much attention to
that area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anti-roll bars should be set to be softer. &nbsp;Softer roll
bars will help the car with mechnical grip. In the dry softer
rollbars give more grip but less steering response, as the car
basically wallows around. &nbsp;This isn't so much a problem in the
wet because grip is so much lower already.</p>

<p>The strategy for developing a setup for the wet is pretty much
the same as the dry.&nbsp; Make adjustments to one component at a
time pay attention to it's effects.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Ever since the 2013 season 1 scheduled was pbublished racing the
Star Mazda was a scary prospect. &nbsp;LRP is one of the two
circuits on the Rookie Road schedule and as such not only is it
well known to every driver, the less experienced drivers all own it
and are therefore more likely to have a crack at the Start Mazda.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>My practice started on Wednesday, trying to find a setup.
&nbsp;Eventually, thanks to my teammates at Vortex I had a decent
baseline, which I then tweaked to my particular, right foot braking
style. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had two cracks at qualifying, following consistently setting
46.3's in practice. &nbsp;My first effort was a 43.5, which while
not too bad, 0.2s is a lot - about 40 places in the overall
standings. &nbsp;On my second run I did get a 46.3 and that was
enough to put me in the mid 34th out of more than 1500
qualifiers.</p>

<p>Qualifying is one thing, but racing is an entirely different
beast at this super slippery and bumpy circuit. &nbsp;I lined up
for the 7:45am race on Sunday morning my time (+10 GMT) in fourth
place in the top split (out of 43 drivers). &nbsp;My race plan was
to drive well within my limits and to give away places rather than
battle and make mistakes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Off the start line I maintained 4th and sat there for a few
laps, losing out 3 seconds on 3rd place, then it blew out to 6
seconds as I took it easy, early on the brakes and late on the
throttle. &nbsp;2nd spun himself out of the race and I moved up to
third, with a 10 second advantage back to 4th. &nbsp; 4th (Fabrizio
Raffa) started to catch me at about 0.5s a lap and when he had the
gap down to 7.5s I started increasing my pace, comfortably pulling
the gap back out to 9.5 seconds. &nbsp;2nd place put it in the wall
and then I was in second. &nbsp;10 laps from the end I came across
a lapped car who did his best to block me for 3 laps and I lost 6
seconds to third place. &nbsp;Suddenly he was 3.5 seconds from me
and &nbsp;with 5 laps to go it was on again. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I managed to hold on to second and score 138 points, my best
ever result, and a good one in a 2438 SOF race.</p>

<p>As round four of the 2013 F1 championship kicks of today in
Bahrain and in the wake of the Chinese Grand Prix, I'm thinking
about the state of modern F1. &nbsp;Is F1 still what it used to be.
&nbsp;Is it drivers championship, where the fastest, smartest
driver wins? &nbsp;Is it a constructors championship, where the
best car wins? &nbsp;Was it ever about?</p>

<p>The constructors part is easy. &nbsp;The car construction brief
can be boiled down to 'Within the regulations of the day, buid the
car that scores the most points'. &nbsp;The team that does that
deserves the title in my opinion (assuming they've got drivers
sufficent to maximise the cars capabilities).</p>

<p>The drivers world championship is a little more complex.
&nbsp;Sure, the driver that accumulates the most points during a
season is 'best' driver. &nbsp;That driver has, better than his
peers, made use of environment in which he has to operate.
&nbsp;What annoys me is when things happen like they did in China.
&nbsp;The most striking comment I heard from a driver during that
race was from Jenson Button when he had to ask his team if he was
racing the car behind. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, F1 has long been about strategy. When to push and when to
pace, about trading off speed against fuel consumption given the
time it takes to pit and refuel (in the days of refuelling) and
about ensuring your engine doesn't go bang. &nbsp;This new Pirelli
era has given us fans and the drivers something else. &nbsp;Tyre
wear is so bad that teams are running vastly different strategies
and drivers don't know who they're racing against because they
don't know what driver is on what strategy. &nbsp;There are
effectively 22 time trial events happening simulatenously on track
as each driver races against the clock. &nbsp;Drivers aren't
pushing all the time. &nbsp;Instead of having a 2 hour / 300 km
flat out sprint we've got a compressed 2 hour / 300 km endurance
race.</p>

<p>Hang on, part of the attraction of F1 for me is the strategy,
the "Moving Chess Game" they like to brand F1 when it gets
"boring". &nbsp;I'm actually a fan of the current format. &nbsp;I
like that I don't know who is going to be the victor. &nbsp;I
remember the Schumacher era still too painfully. &nbsp;The Red
Baron would bolt into the distance and it was a race for second
place. &nbsp;Those times were the only in my 25 plus years of
watching F1 where I struggled to maintian interest watching races
in the middle of the night (here in Australia). &nbsp;Now I can't
fall asleep because the current leader being the race winner is not
a foregone conclusiong. &nbsp;Being an Australian (and therefore I
sort of have to support Webber - plus I like the guy) that means
there's always hope. &nbsp;It's possible my driver could mount a
late race charge, or that drivers further up the field could drop
back as their tyres "fall off the cliff". &nbsp;I've also long been
a big fan of the constructors side of it. The guys on the pitwall
and in the factory are the real superstars. &nbsp;F1 now more than
ever is a team sport. There's no way a driver can keep tabs on
every driver in the field, as far as their strategies go.
&nbsp;Drivers need their support crew. &nbsp;Gone are the days of
grabbing the fastest driver and plugging him into your car and
collecting the wins (contrary to what I just said, part of me cried
as I wrote that).</p>

<p>We're also now seeing more action than ever. &nbsp;Yes its fake
action in some cases, and I think this season with generally two
DRS zones there will be artificial overtaking, but it's better than
those Schumacher dominance days.</p>

<p>After the second half of last season I thought 2012 was going to
be unique. &nbsp;I thought we wouldn't see multiple race winners at
the start of the season. &nbsp;Thankfully we've got that again in
2013. &nbsp;What I think we will see though is the same set of few
(3 or 4) winners take wins at different circuits for at least the
first half of the season, and probably beyond. &nbsp;With 2014
engine changes getting ever close teams will invariably start to
shift their focus. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why didn't someone tell me this earlier! Last season two mates
changed from the Star Mazda to the MP4/12 for Season 1 2013.
&nbsp;I kept racing the SM, getting hit by noobs.</p>

<p>I had a small go of the MP4/12C when it first came out in the
week 13, but I didn't do any formal races or practice session.
&nbsp;Now, as part of Week 13 24 hours of fun, I've had a taste for
competition and I like it. &nbsp;I was tossing up racing the car
next season anyway, but now this has made up my mind. &nbsp;The car
is much more enjoyable to drive than the V8Supercar (and apparently
a good bit faster - according to times at Interlagos). &nbsp;It
also looks fantastic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="/media/1253/season-openersml.png" width="800" height="301" alt="Season Opener sml"/></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Season 2 of 2013 kicked off today
and after a successful campaign running the Star Mazda for Vortex
last season, after 4 seasons in the open wheeler I've signed a deal
to drive the GT series with the same team. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll be competing in both the GT Challenge series and the Grand
Am series.</p>

<p>In the GT Challenge series the Mclaren MP4/12C runs in the GT3
configuration against the Ford GT GT2 and Corvette C6R. &nbsp;This
will be not only my first closed wheel race series in 2 years,
it'll be my first multi-class race series.</p>

<p>In the Grand Am series the Mclaren lines up against the Riley
MKXX Daytona Prototype, a seriously rapid car. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've long been a Mclaren fan and to drive a Mclaren is something
special, so I'm really looking forward to this new challenge and to
proving myself across more types of racing.</p>

<p>After the opening practice session at Laguna Seca, I finished
the day in 2nd place with a time of 1:23.447, set on full tanks.
&nbsp;I couldn't go faster on low fuel, so there's some setup work
to do as I learn the car.</p>

<p>For a long time I've wanted a driving game where I can just
drive. &nbsp;Not race, or rally, or do silly little street races;
just get in a drive - clock up the kilometers on the road and let
my mind wander to other things. &nbsp;Off the bat though, I should
admit I am a fan of driving. &nbsp;Just getting in the car in real
life and going for a drive for an hour or three or more. &nbsp; If
you're in the right mood, driving is relaxing. &nbsp;You can play
your favourite songs and just enjoy the physicality of turning the
wheel, pushing the brake, accelerator, clutch, and changing gears -
all to create a smooth, consistent, almost rhythmic zen state with
the black stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1007/trucking.jpg" width="950" height="245" alt="trucking"/>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>In Game</h3>

<p>The starting premise of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is simple, you
know how to drive big rigs, you obviously like driving, and you
aspire to own and work in your own trucking company. &nbsp;As you
buckle up for your first job you're shown your shabby tin shed
garage and told of your lack of ownership of the diesel destroyers
of road. &nbsp;But that's ok. &nbsp;You know how to drive and there
are plenty of trucking companies offering contract driving gigs
from and to the locations of your choice.</p>

<p>ETS2 isn't a full blown simulator. &nbsp;It won't take you 3
hours to transport your load from Dover to Calais, longer if you
take the Ferry. &nbsp;English channel journeys are fast forwarded,
with your truck either being floated across or travelling
subterrainean. From my own investigates the world seems to zip by
at about 1 kilometer per 2 or so seconds, even though the
impression of speed is still accurate. &nbsp;I guess even I would
find sitting on a 80km stretch of highway boring in realtime.
&nbsp;There are some nice scenery to look at on the way though,
especially if you're not native to Europe. &nbsp;I haven't driven
much through mainlaind Europe but I have enjoyed the white cliffs
of Dover in England and it's mainland tunnel exit, Calias.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attention to detail is pretty good too. &nbsp;I love driving
in the rain and the rain effects. &nbsp;The noise on windscreen and
the noise of my wipers is soothing, as it is in real life wet
weather cruising. &nbsp;Just remember to turn your lights on or
you'll have to pay $150. &nbsp;Another thing I found out. &nbsp;And
pay attention to your fatigue levels. &nbsp;You'll get fined pretty
heavily for missing then. &nbsp;And the fines will keep coming
until you find an appropriate place to pull over and rest.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I liked the levels of traffic on the highway. &nbsp;There were
enough cars to keep me interested but not too many that I felt I
was driving in peak hour (though I do hope that does happen!).
&nbsp;I've read the game also has real life landmarks. I've not
bean to the channel tunnel entrance but a quick look at google
images results tells me that it looks the same in game as it does
in real life. &nbsp;cool! :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>ETS2 makes use of Internet radio streams in game. &nbsp;You can
select (via the menu) the stream you want, from hundreds, or add
your own, and listen to the real radio while you clock up the
miles. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Technical Stuff</h3>

<p>Getting technical, the game completely supported my combination
of G27 wheel and Fanatec Clubsport pedals. &nbsp;Before playing I
wondered how it would handle truck gearboxes having more than 6
gears. &nbsp;It handles it quite elegantly, using a user-designated
button to shift between the two ranges 1-6 and 7-12. &nbsp;There
are also two more gear range styles, but this works well enough in
my opinion. &nbsp;Generally 1-6 is good for navigating tight turns
in the city, but once you get about 25 mph you're going to need 7th
and beyond. &nbsp;By mapping my range selection button to button 0
on my G27 H-shifter (the first button on the left) &nbsp;I was able
to quickly bump that button when I desired to move between the
ranges.</p>

<p>The game also works well with SoftTH and triple screens, better
than many other driving games out there, and second only to
iRacing. &nbsp;Although it does annoyingly seem to require changing
back to 1920x1200 and then to my widescreen res each time I start
the game. &nbsp;But that's no biggie for the joy of triple
screens.</p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>I really do enjoy the game, and did from the first 5 minutes.
&nbsp;While driving in game I thought of another component of real
life trucking, communications with other drivers. &nbsp;This is
missing from this game. &nbsp;Yes, I realise this is a single
player game and therefore implementing this would be quite
difficult, though it could still work in a single player
environment. &nbsp;I'd like to be able to jump on my simulated CB
radio and talk to other trucks, or at least listen. &nbsp; I have a
few friends who would enjoy this game, and I think being able to
drive through the game while chatting to your mates who are doing
the same would be awesome. &nbsp;So would be a MMO or multiplayer
option, where me and my friends all work for the same trucking
company. &nbsp;</p>

            <tags><![CDATA[red bull,Formula 1,vettel]]></tags>
            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I blogged about why team orders are ok just after the
Alonso/Massa incident at Germany 2010. &nbsp;My opinion hasn't
changed. &nbsp;You can read about my thoughts <a
href="/{localLink:1398}"
title="Why formula 1 team orders are ok">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident between Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark
Webber at last weekends Malaysian GP has ignited forums, blogs,
facebook and twitter around the globe, as fans of the sport and
fans of each of the drivers vboice their opinions on who is to
blame and on team orders themselves. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For the casual F1 fan, and the general public common consesus is
that the from Vettel was the right one. &nbsp;After all, in racing
shouldn't the fastest driver win?</p>

<p>It's never that simple though, for Webber was
<strong>not</strong> slower than Vettel. &nbsp;This is<span>&nbsp;a
multi-variable topic, so I'm focussing on this incident.</span></p>

<h3>Melbourne, a week ago</h3>

<p><span>The scene needs to be set a little with the performance of
the Red Bull in Melbourne last week. They were clearly the fastest
car over a single lap and were nearly unbackable odds for a win,
but they found out (first race of the season so it was new to them
and everyone else) that their tyres degrade faster than some of the
other cars, and that cost them valuable position. They worked hard
over the last week to figure out their tyre wear problems and
hopefully devise a strategy to not have a repeat
performance.</span></p>

<h3>Now at Malaysia</h3>

<p><span>This race, Webber started 6th and was 2nd by lap two,
behind Vettel. He then got past Vettel after the first round of
stops. I sat watching the race, one eye on the tv and one on my
timing app and Webber had the measure of Vettel throughout the
race. Every time they pitted, he came out a little bit further in
front.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Vettel made a radio complaint that Webber was too slow and
holding him up. The very next lap Webber was 0.7s faster then
Vettel (a lot). The reality was Webber was doing exactly enough to
stay in the lead, while keeping his tyre wear to a
minimum.</span><br />
<br />
<span>F1 has a limit of 8 engines per year, so the teams are also
focussed on not pushing the engine hard. After the last pitstops it
was Webber that emerged in front of Vettel. At that point BOTH
drivers were told to turn their engines down (this changes the
engine mapping - electronics - to reduce engine power and fuel
consumption and increase life). This is actually a common strategy
used by teams after the last round of stops when they have a
comfortable gap. Webber made reference to a pre-race understanding
in his post-race comments. Based on history, that generally means
"maintain position after the last stops". Vettel admits to hearing
the message to slow down but chose to ignore it. Webber heard the
message and did as he was instructed. It wasn't the case that
Webber was slower. He proved through the entire race he easily had
the pace. The team boss has admitted Vettel heard the message then
turned his engine mapping up to full - giving him maximum possible
engine power, while Webber was running at a minimum. With that he
was able to blast past Webber and take the win.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>If anything it was the team order that lost Webber the race,
because he did as he was ordered and Vettel did
not.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>There is also a very "colourful" history between these two
guys, starting in Istanbul 2010 when Vettel speared into the side
of Webber, who was at the time leading the race. As a result both
cars were taken out and the team took no points.</span><br />
<span>From a team point of view it didn't matter in what order the
drivers finished, as the team would get the same amount of points.
Points are critical because the budget for the next year is based
on how many championship points are won in the current season. More
points equals more money. A lot more money. With that in mind,
teams are very careful to ensure their drivers (a) don't crash into
each other and (b) make it to the end. Thats where team orders come
into play.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>What Vettel did was ignore the direct instructions of his
employers, shaft his agreement with his "teammate", and not just
light, but add extra gunpowder to the powderkeg that has been
waiting to explode. It was a really shitty thing to do allround. He
knows it too.</span></p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Over the seasons on iRacing I've iterated over my approach to
racing in order to ensure I have the least number of incidents.
&nbsp;After last season I have identified a few places where I'm
weak when it comes to racing.</p>

<p>In the past I've always been a right foot braker and taking a
late turn in. &nbsp;To do this I get right out wide and then turn
in sharply, sorting out the rear end as I go. &nbsp;Left foot
brakers tend to turn in earlier and take a more traditional
constant arc through a turn. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe my style of cornering encourages drivers to divebomb.
&nbsp;I am led to believe this when last season it seemed I was
attacked this way on a number of occasions and because I tried to
avoid incidents I'd back out of the throttle and let the car past.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>By taking a more defensive and earlier turn-in, following
drivers should be less likely to try and "stick it up the inside"
as they should hopefully note a smaller and earlier decreasingly
smaller gap into each turn. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've also been subjected to what I would consider unsporting and
ungentleman-like behaviour such as moving to block in the braking
zone and weavng multiple times down the straight to prevent me
passing. &nbsp;At each time these actions really annoyed me, but
everyone approaches racing differently and after the recent
real-life antics of Sebastian Vettel, and the reaction to his
driving style, I think what these drivers are doing is within the
limits of sporting on most occasions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pretty much all commentators agree that Vettels style of driving
is the style of true champions. &nbsp;The true greats see an
opportunity and they take it. Damned be the feelings of their
competitors.</p>

<p>I think to make me more competitive I need to be more assertive
when I race, and that definitely includes placinh my car in
positions where drivers feel they have a shot at making a move.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>I've just completed my debut week in the McLaren MP4/12C as a GT
racer and I'm satisfied. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My goal for this week was simply to finish the week with
confidence in the car; confidence that with me behind the wheel,
the car wouldn't spear off the track seemingly randomly. &nbsp;I
wasn't concerned with competitiveness and was toying with the idea
of starting from pit-lane, just to ensure I didn't over do it.
&nbsp;As it turned out I didn't need to because other drivers
helped me start from pitlane...</p>

<p>I practice all during the week, starting on Tuesday with no
confidence the car. &nbsp;I couldn't get the thing to the apex
without the back end stepping out on me. &nbsp;Almost every corner
in qualifying trim was like that, and the car wasn't much better
with race fuel onboard. &nbsp;I sought guidance from my teammates
at Vortex and tried alterting the diff lock and shifting weight
rearward but still to no effect. &nbsp;A big thing was the physical
braking didn't feel "right". &nbsp;As any driver will tell you, if
they're not confident with the feel of the car, they have no basis
to build performance on.</p>

<p>Thursday night, after making no progress with my apex attitude,
I pulled my pedals out, relubed them and set them up for proper
left foot braking, including significantly reducing the throw of
the brake.</p>

<p>Instantly the car was easier to handle and my apex problem was
solved. &nbsp;Finally I could start working with the car proper,
and building up to a fast lap. &nbsp;Strangely I didn't get any
faster, just more consistent. &nbsp;I must have fluked in that one
super lap with the old pedal set. I did beat it on Saturday, but
only by 0.04s, to do a 1:22.709.</p>

<p>Saturday morning qualifying and I spent the entire 20 minutes
laying down times. First with the race fuel load and then with
qualifying load, using the unmodified team Q set (which JCG the
team captain had taken to a 1:22.275). &nbsp;My best time was a
1:23.089. &nbsp;Not bad and not my best ever time. &nbsp;I've
rarely gone sub 1:23.0 so I didn't bother trying qualifying again.
&nbsp;Instead I started my race campaign.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 1</h3>

<p>I qualified 2nd on the grid (of the Mclarens) and to my surprise
found that this series uses a rolling start. Something new to me.
&nbsp;Approaching the corkscrew on the warmup lap, the corvette in
front of me came to a complete stop. &nbsp;I hit the brakes and
tapped him and the car behind me slammed into my rear. &nbsp;My car
was instantly bent out of shape. The pits were closed on the warmup
lap so I had to do another tour and then pit. &nbsp;After a 8
minute stop I came out 6 laps down and the pressure was off for any
decent performance. &nbsp;I did manage to claw back a few places
through attrition, and I didn't get any more incidents, to finish
in 5th place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 2</h3>

<p>I toyed with the idea of starting from the pits but instead
elected to start from my 3rd place on the grid. &nbsp;The two cars
in front of me both qualified with 1:22.2's so I didn't hold any
chance for the race. &nbsp;On the end of the warmup lap the 2nd
place car made a mistake and by turn 1 of lap 1 I was in second but
ran wide through turn 1. &nbsp;I held it together but it was enough
for that car to come back up the inside. &nbsp;He lost control of
the rear under accelation from that turn and tapped me then knifed
across my front and put me straight into the wall. &nbsp;A few
tentative laps (and many lost places) and I got used to the
handling of my car, and was able to lap in the 1:25's consistnetly
(about 1.5s off my undamaged race pace). &nbsp;Again I made no more
incidents and managed to bring the car home in 6th place (after
falling down to 14th).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 3</h3>

<p>Again I started 3rd. &nbsp;This time I made it past the warmup
and first lap. &nbsp;On lap 2 I was again hit as 4th place
accelarated out of the last corner and tried to pass me on the
outside. Fortunately for him he lost his rear on acceleration but
had me to bounce off. &nbsp;Unfortunately for me I was put nose
first into the pit straight wall. &nbsp;I recovered many places
down, with a badly damaged front end and no bonnet but my car felt
ok. &nbsp;It felt more consistent than the previous two races.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a few spins and three slow downs after accidentally
cutting the corkscrew. &nbsp;I fought my way back to up what would
have been 5th place except I lost control on the last corner of the
race and stopped parked in the middle of the road. &nbsp;The 2nd
place driver came to put a lap on me but hit he Corvette in front
of him who had hit me as I tried to recover. &nbsp;My fault :(
&nbsp;I eventually claimed another 6th place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 4</h3>

<p>Finally I had a race where I didn't get badly damaged on the
opening laps. &nbsp;I did however have a few spins of my own this
time. &nbsp;I again started in 3rd place. &nbsp;I got caught out a
multiple times when I had to let Corvettes by, but that's all part
of the fun :) &nbsp; I had a few troubles with lapped MP4 drivers
not getting out of the way but overall the mistakes were my own
fault and I enjoyed some good racing. &nbsp;Again I finished
6th.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Race 5</h3>

<p>I don't normally race late on a Sunday (8pm) but my wife asked
me if I was going to race, so I took that as her saying she had
stuff she wanted to do so I should go race. &nbsp;So I did. &nbsp;I
started from 8th position in a field of about 25 Mclarens, the
biggest MP4 contigent yet that also include teammate Cyril Floris.
I was up to fourth position for a good while before a few self
induced spins and a slow down through the corkscrew. &nbsp;I also
got spun off track when I back marker I was lapping decided to try
and retake the position and bombdived me. &nbsp;Annoying, as I'd
closed in on him at 2 seconds a lap only to have him try to repass
at the corner after I took him.. &nbsp;Heading for 3rd place I came
round the corner up the hill toward the corkscrew but lost the back
end and went headfirst into the tyre barrier. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I reversed out and got going again, having lost two places (one
of the people to pass was Cyril) and I gave chase again. &nbsp;I
started closing on both the two drivers who got by but made another
mistake. &nbsp;Then I'd close up again. &nbsp;I eventually finished
in another 6th place (lol!) after spinning from 5th on the last lap
after closing down a 6 second gap to Cyril to only 1.5s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I had a good fun weekend. I was annoyed by the number of times I
got taken out by other drivers. &nbsp;Overall the drivers seems to
be more careful off the start line, which was great. Normally I'm
the one being overly cautious but in that last race I was going
much slower than what I'd like but didn't want to try and pass and
have us both (or more people) off. &nbsp;I also some some pretty
dodgy driving from guys in front. &nbsp;Moves I would consider
overly aggressive. &nbsp;That said, there were a number of nice
drivers who played the smart long game and would leave racing room.
&nbsp;Good to see.</p>

<p>As I stated in my goal for the week, I just wanted to get a feel
for the car and I not only managed that, I found I also had decent
car speed.</p>

<p><img src="/media/3582/Indianapolis-RoadCourse.JPG" width="500" height="300" alt="Indianapolis-RoadCourse.JPG" style="float: left;"/>I enjoyed Indianapolis road from the first lap.
&nbsp;It's got a good flow of corners that combine low speed and
high speed corners. &nbsp;Indianapolis road uses a portion of the
classic Indianapolis Oval track, home of the legendary Indy 500,
with an inner road portion, as used by MotoGP and Formula 1.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The oval portion wants a low downforce stiffly spring setup,
while the twisty inner wants a high downforce softer setup.
Basically it's a compromise. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I started off with the Laguna Seca set and made a few changes to
soften the rear and stiffen the front; the way I have run my Star
Mazda. &nbsp;The handling was pretty much how I wanted it, in that
it was very stable. However, Cyril made the point that such a high
downforce will kill me on the straights and won't give me enough
front end grip, which will punish me over 35 laps. &nbsp;With that
in mind I reduced the rear wing to 5 (from 9).</p>

<p>I managed to do a few laps in the 1:25.9's and to lower my
optimal time to a 1:25.4. &nbsp;Fast, but not super fast.
&nbsp;About where I usually am, even with the Star Mazda. &nbsp;I
was topping, or near topping every practice session. &nbsp;I seem
to have made an improvement from last week, comparative to the rest
of the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This weeks race schedule was messed up. &nbsp;I was too tired
(from my 7 month old son crying all night on Thursday night) to
qualifying on Friday, or do any practice laps for that matter. As a
result I qualified on Saturday morning and joined up for the 10am
race. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I qualified 3rd, my worst (and average) position. &nbsp;I was
also immediately behind teammate Cyril Rodriguez, who qualified
0.5s faster than me (my 1:26.0 versus his 1:25.5). &nbsp;I stuck
with him for a few laps, with 2nd place spinning at the first
corner a few laps in. &nbsp;Eventually I started to fall back for a
tenth, then a few tenths, then a second. &nbsp;Once I'd lost that
tow down the straight I couldn't keep up. &nbsp;Even if I had the
pace through the twisty infield (and it seemed I did).</p>

<p>Californian Anthony Bonner was the car ranked just below mine,
and starting a few places back. &nbsp;He made his way quickly to my
rear and by about 10 laps in he was close behind. He had slightly
more pace, especially on the oval portion, where lap after lap I
watched him catch 0.3s per lap, while I would get 0.3 back on him
through the infield.</p>

<p>Soon enough the Corvette drivers caught us to put a lap down. At
this point Cyril was gone, some 10 seconds up the road. &nbsp;We
lost both lost time getting out of the way of overly (in my
opinion) agressive C6R drivers, who muscled their way past.</p>

<p>We raced on lap after lap, for the most part I maintained a
greater than 1.0s advantaged. &nbsp;I really needed that gap.
&nbsp;While these cars don't run DRS (unlike F1), if you get within
1.0's the aero benefits are significant and given Anthony's already
faster straightline speed, if he got a tow, it would be all over
for me.</p>

<p>Eventually he got the tow he needed and about 6 laps from the
end he breezed by into 2nd place just before the braking zone for
turn 1. &nbsp;I sat behind him, within 0.3s until the second lap.
My car was definitely faster through the infield, while he was
quicker down the straight. &nbsp;I managed to hold on to the tow.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately with a lap and a bit to go Scott Wild in fourth
place came up to put us a lap down and I lost 2 seconds getting out
of the way for him. &nbsp;I couldn't make those two seconds up and
I finished 2.3s behind Anythony. &nbsp;With small consolation I was
the 2nd fastest overall single lap, with a 1:26.468, 0.15s behind
Cyrils best. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Anthony and I had 0 incidents during the race, and a very
rewarding battle. &nbsp;Overall I was very satisfied with the
result.</p>

<p>The only disappointing thing was the SOF. &nbsp;Because it was
so low (1532) I only socred 78 points. &nbsp;Much less than my
effort for 6th place last week.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><img src="/media/3642/Okayama-Full.JPG" width="500" height="305" alt="Okayama-Full.JPG" style="float: left;"/>Round 4 of the GT Challenge series saw us make the
virtual journey to the Land of the Rising sun the the Okayama (AKA
Aidia) crircuit, host of Formula 1 Grand Prix's of the not to
distant past.</p>

<p>Okayama Short is one of two circuits on the Rookie Series (MX5)
rotation, and as such everyone is familiar with it. That also means
it's included in the initial bundle, so everyone owns it. &nbsp;I
expected a large turnout because of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GT Challenge series, with Corvettes, Mclarens, and Ford GT's
aren't particular suited to this thin track. &nbsp;It's not a bad
track but the twisty nature can make it challenging for the
Corvette drivers and challenging for the faster Mclaren drivers who
are immediately behind the, because it is the Mclaren drivers that
have to fight with the slower Corvettes. &nbsp;That was my undoing
on more than one occasion.</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>As usual, I practiced during the week, up until the weekend.
&nbsp;I managed a few 1:28.9s. &nbsp;At the end of the first days
practice I was doing 1:29.2's and on day two I managed a 1:28.9 and
it never got any faster. &nbsp; The difference between this and
last week, and especially week 1, was the time it took me to get
used to the car. &nbsp;I think I'm pretty much used to the car now.
&nbsp;I'm maybe not super confident with it and I certainly cannot
yet resolve problems using car setup, but I could probably race in
the first few days now.</p>

<h3>Qualifying</h3>

<p>Probably thanks to increased car feel confidence I did my
qualifying session on Thursday night this week and managed a 1:29.0
in the closing stages. &nbsp;Seeing as 1:28.9 was as good as it got
in practice and the 1:29.0 was set on my last lap in qualifying,
having just crossed the line before the flag came out, I thought it
was fast "enough". &nbsp;As it turns out it was good enough for the
rest of the weekend. &nbsp;I didn't always have high strengths of
field, but my worst starting position was 3rd and I got 2 pole
positions.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p><img src="/media/3973/okayama-mp4-races.jpg" alt="2013s02w03"/></p>

<p>The races were "interesting". &nbsp;I was leading race 1, after
closely battling with Chris E Pence for much of the rac.e &nbsp;I
followed him with 0.5s for the first 15 or so laps until he finally
made a big enough mistake on the exit of turn 11 for me to pass
down the straight and into turn 1. &nbsp;Then he sat on my tail by
about the same amount. &nbsp;After about 5 more laps, and feeling
like I had him covered until the end of the race, I got
power-oversteer on the exit of Redman and lost it into the wall.
&nbsp;I thought the damage was minor, as my front left brushed the
concrete fence, but I had 14 minutes of repairs and that was
it.</p>

<p>Race 3 was intrestering in that it was my first time starting
from pole. behind the "faster" Corvettes. &nbsp;I say "faster"
because there were three or four Corvettes doing battle right in
front of me that were very much holding me up. &nbsp;Blocking me
into the corners then using their straight line speed advantage to
pull away down the straights. &nbsp;After about 7 laps three of
them had a coming together and I slowed right down to avoid.
&nbsp;Luckily I did avoid but in the melee I lost not just 1st
place but 2nd. &nbsp;I managed to move into 2nd place again but by
then I'd lost 9 seconds to first, after losing time behind 2nd
place. &nbsp;I eventually closed the gap to first down to 4 seconds
but he had more pace than me anyway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Race 4 and I was off pole again. &nbsp;I pulled away easily into
the lead, doing 1:28.2 on the third lap. Again the Corvettes held
me up but this time I managed to get through. I was also helped out
by a weaker stength of field. &nbsp;By lap 26 I had built up a 37
second lead over 2nd place, when the lead and 2nd place Corvettes
came to put me a lap down. &nbsp;As usual the lead Corvette tried
to muscle his way through and took us both out of the race!
&nbsp;The 2nd place Vette hit the first placed but managed to go on
to win. &nbsp;I bet Jordan Barris, back in 2nd place in the MP4 was
happy!</p>

<p><img src="/media/4085/1369588990.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt="1369588990" style="float: left;"/>While
there wasn't a whole lot of overtaking at yesterdays Monaco Grand
Prix, there was a fair bit going on. &nbsp;Probably the most driver
dramatic driver of the day was Mclarens Sergio Perez, who was the
architect of a number of impressive moves and also of his own
justified demise.</p>

<p>Earlier in his Mclaren career Perez came under heavy fire from
his team for a lack of aggression in races. &nbsp;He took that on
board for recent races and at the previous race in Spain was seen
banging wheels with his teammate, to the point where Button was on
the radio back to his team voicing concerns for his own safety.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perez did not put that behind him in Monaco. &nbsp;Instead, he
seemed to come to the mediterranean principality even more fired
up. &nbsp;Now, Monaco is a hard place to pass and you need to get
pretty assertive to get by. &nbsp;Sutil managed it with style, but
in my book Perez was over the top. &nbsp;</p>

<p>His first attempt on Button failed, and he only kept his
position by cutting the chicane. &nbsp;I thought he was wrongly
going to get away with that, but thankfully he had to give it back
a few laps later. &nbsp;After Jenson had already complained to his
team about his own teammate, and he had every right to complain.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perez also fired it up in the inside of Alsonso, and Alonso
jumped out of the way, going across the chicane, but losing the
position to Perez.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perez, full of confidence in his ability to "shove it up the
inside" after the tunnel, tried to replicate that move on Raikkonen
toward the end of the race. &nbsp;This time Kimi drifted toward
apex earlier that he previously had, closing the door on Perez and
putting him in the wall. &nbsp;The move put both Kimi and Perez
across the chicane, with Kimi being the victor. &nbsp; Both
suffered car damage as a result. Perez had wing (and probably
suspension) damage, while Kimi had a left rear puncture from
Perez's front wing.</p>

<p>This move was different than those executed on Button and
Alonso. &nbsp;Perez was carrying visibly more speed into the turn,
evidence by the trajectory of both cars after the collision.
&nbsp;It appeared to me that Perez was never going to make that
corner had Raikkonen not been there for him to bounce
off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In commentary, Martin Brundle said the Raikkonen should have
left racing room. &nbsp;I'm all for racing room but I don't believe
Perez was entitled to it in this case. &nbsp;Why not? &nbsp;Mainly
because Perez wasn't at least halfway alongside Kimi as they
started braking. &nbsp;Classic bombdive. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Another point is why should drivers give racing room in this
precise situation. &nbsp;Perez was aggressive, not assertive. Too
aggressive. &nbsp;It's wrong (unsporting) to bombdive someone and
then expect them to jink offline and give you room to complete your
bombdive. &nbsp;It's happened to me a number of times in iRacing
and unlike Kimi, I'll yield avoid contact if I see it happening.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do sympathise with Kimi too, because just last week at Laguna
Seca in the GT Challenge series was in second place and on the last
corner of the last lap third place tried to go up the side, in a
last ditch attempt I could see coming a mile away. I pointed my car
toward the apex and in a carbon-copy replica of Kimi's move
yesterday, I squeezed him out of the apex. &nbsp;He already has his
brakes locked, we collided. Fourth took us both and got second,
while I continued on for 3rd place. &nbsp;In the aftermath I was
accused of moving underbraking. &nbsp;Of course this was true.
&nbsp;I moved from the turn in point in a straight line to the
apex. &nbsp;What I didn't to was weave while braking. &nbsp; In
this case the driver told me that all braking should be done a
straight line (which it was, straight at the apex) where that
straght line is parallel with the edge of the track, so I was
moving under braking. LOL.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/3757/Sebring-International.JPG" width="500" height="335" alt="Sebring-International.JPG" style="float: left;"/></p>

<p>I don't mind me some Sebring action, even if I haven't spent a
lot of time here. &nbsp;I figured the circuit should lend itself
well to overtaking, with the wide (in places) track. &nbsp;Many of
the corners are quite difficult, meaning people will be coming off
a lot.</p>

<p>This week didn't turn out to be the big jump in iRating I was
expecting. &nbsp;Mid week I found the fun of MX-5's at Laguna Seca.
&nbsp;I did a few races in that car there and saw my SR drop a bit
but my iRating increase by about 200. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>As usual I started practice on Tuesday night and started turning
some decent lap times. &nbsp;Nothing blindingly quick but I was
down in the 2:02's after about an hour or two.</p>

<p>Later in the week I managed to do a 2:01.9, with an optimal of
2:01.0. &nbsp;Not the fastest in world, or even my team, but fast
enough to get some good results, top 5's in the races.</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>I didn't get to qualifying until Saturday morning and it was
heart-breaking. &nbsp;I had a number of off's during the 20 minute
period, and a number of 1x's at turn 7. &nbsp;Starting my final
qualifying lap, I nailed turn 1 and was 0.1 up on my optimal time
and 0.4 up on my PB, through the first corner alone. &nbsp;It got
better. By the time I got to turn 7 I was 0.8s up on my personal
best. &nbsp;Then disaster. &nbsp;After seeing how far in front I
was, I as usual I tightened up. &nbsp;This caused me to mistake
into T7 and I got a 1x on the inside of the turn. &nbsp;I
hesistated for a moment and then thought 'You know what, I'll keep
going hard and see what I can do'. Pushing hard, I crossed the line
with a 2:00.8, my fastest ever lap and better than my previous
optimal. It would have put me in the top 20 in the world. &nbsp;But
my "banker lap" was the only one that countered, a 2:03.2!</p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p><img src="/media/4326/sebring-mp4-races.jpg" alt="2013s2w4"/></p>

<p>Racing certainly didn't go as planned. &nbsp;My first race was
an unmitigated disaster. &nbsp;I started 6th in a huge field and
lost it on the last corner of the first lap. From there I dropped
back to be third last, after luckily avoiding anyone else. &nbsp;I
started my charge back up the field and made short work of the Ford
GT's in front of me. &nbsp;I closed up behind the Mclarens but then
lost control of my car again, and again, and again. &nbsp;It seemed
each time I closed the gap down to trio of Qiang Gao, Manu
Heikkila, and Matt Malone. &nbsp;Matt (black and blue Ford GT) was
in the Ford GT but he was flying, as best he could anyway.
&nbsp;Time and again he'd nail me out of the last turn and I'd
battle to get by the rest of the lap. &nbsp;Good fun.</p>

<p>Qian Gao was bad though. &nbsp;He was all over the road braking
early, going slow through the corners, baulking. &nbsp;After the
race I see he has an iRating of 1095, so I'm not really surprised.
&nbsp;He had decent pace when he could keep it on the track (his
race PB was 2.1 seconds less than mine), just he couldn't keep it
on track very often (He is the green car in my video below).
&nbsp;Manu was fine, just not so fast (the Pink car). &nbsp;</p>

<p>At one point I was right behind Gao, with the leaders coming to
put us a lap down. &nbsp;In my desire to both not lose time and not
wreck the leaders I went up in the inside of Gao (see video). At
the time I thought I'd hit him and I pulled to the right and slowed
down to let him past. &nbsp;Watching the replay after the race I
didn't even come close.</p>

<p>The race was so bad from a POV of me making mistakes that I had
to record it. &nbsp;</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="16CuajpkgSA" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="" /> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Race 2 didn't fair much better. &nbsp;My own teammate spun on
the last corner of the warmup lap triggering a four car collision
that included me. &nbsp;I was able to get going with no noticeable
change in car handling, but I'd slipped down the field. &nbsp;I
started making places up when I noticed a Ford GT catch and pass me
down the straight. &nbsp;That's not right and I looked down at my
pedal readout. &nbsp;I had the throttle pressed flat to the floor
and iRacing was registering only 75%. &nbsp;No wonder the Ford
could pass me. &nbsp;I battle with that for half a lap before
decided to pull the pedals out and plug back in, hopeflly fixing
the problem. &nbsp;I unfortunately pulled the wheel out and when I
plugged it back in I had lost all firmness in the wheel. &nbsp;This
made the force feedback more pronounced and it made the car hard to
drive straight. &nbsp;When I reset the pedals I had a weirdly
functioning brake, so I had to do it again. &nbsp;By now I was 45s
down from 2nd last and the car was weacing all over the road down
the straight and I started to collect a lot of 1x. &nbsp;I pulled
over and retired.</p>

<p>All I wanted was a good clean race where I didn't make stupid
mistakes, or others didn't make errors that impacted me. &nbsp;In
race 3 I got it. &nbsp;I made a clean start and waited my time
before passing cars. The 4 cars that finished ahead of me were all
faster, so 5th was as good as it was going to get. &nbsp;I finished
the race satisfied.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In retrospect and as my team captain pointed out, I shouldn't
have raced the MX-5's this week and should have instead focussed on
practicing at Sebring. Sebring is not a track I'm overly familiar
with from previous experience in other cars.</p>

<p>It was a long time coming, my first win in the GT Challenge
series. I've come close a few times at the last few circuits.
&nbsp;Notably when I had a 37 second lead in Okayama, only to be
taken out by the lead Corvette. &nbsp;This win wasn't a massive
feat, but I'll take it anyway.</p>

<p>I started of pretty quick from day one at Brands Hatch and I was
closer to my teammates in Qualifying than ever before, and while I
didn't get a lot of race time this weekend, I made it count when it
mattered and secured a 2nd and a 1st, from three starts. I also got
a pole position (and two 2nd place starts).</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>Practice started on Tuesday night as usual and I took Stephane's
set and worked with that. I only made a few changes, increased the
ABS from 3 to 8, added 2 clicks more fuel, and 1 click more front
tyre pressure (141 kpa). &nbsp;From the tuesday I managed to turn a
1:24.4 in practice, 0.4s faster than the qualifying time Cyril
Rodreguez my own benchmark managed in the MP4/12C in the Grand-Am
series a few weeks ago. &nbsp;It was also only 0.6 behind team
leader Stephane. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I practice for qualifying pace on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday nights. &nbsp;I didn't better my 1:24.4 but I got into the
1:24.4's a number of times and pushed my optimal down to a
1:23.700.</p>

<h3>Qualifying</h3>

<p>I kept improving through the session and managed a 1:24.345,
just eclipsing my practice best. I'd have gone even faster but I
made a small mistake on the last corner. &nbsp;Ultimately the rest
of the lap was as good as I was ever going to get it, so the small
mistake on the final turn mattered little. &nbsp;</p>

<p>By the end of the week my qualifying time was 67th fastest out
of 206, and 4th fastest in Australia/NZ. I was 0.1s behind my
teammates Christian (#61) and Cyril Rodriguez (#62), who both have
higher iRating's than I do, so it wasn't too bad an effort.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>I did three races over the weekend, my racing limited by a
weekend long visit by my mother. I raced once on friday, and twice
on Sunday aternoon.</p>

<p><img src="/media/4393/brandshatch-mp4.jpg" alt="Brandshatch-mp4"/></p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8334063&amp;custid=59619">
Race 1</a> was good, even if there were only a few MP4's. &nbsp;I
qualified 2nd behind Coppers Laurent, who I know is faster than me
from the Star Mazda series, and he qualified 0.5 faster than I did.
&nbsp;He pulled away at a decent race and finished about half a
minute ahead of me, while I pulled away from third place without a
worry. &nbsp;I got one incident and had an otherwise uneventful
race for 88 points. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8347589&amp;custid=59619">
Race 2</a> and I started from pole and pulled out a 6.5 second gap
by lap three. &nbsp;Eduardo Prado a few places back, not
qualifying, and with an iRating of (3608) I expected him to carve
through the field. &nbsp;He'd made it into second by lap four and
didnt' seem to be closing much if any, when I came across a spun
Corvette (ranked 15 out of 19 cars, and hte lowest ranked
Corvette). &nbsp;Knowing Corvettes and their impulses to pass
whever they feel like it and seeing this guy was low ranked I moved
over and opened the door for him to pass. &nbsp;We went into turn 5
with me very left and him on the inside. &nbsp;I drove around the
left edge of the track but he drove straight into me and put me
into the wall. &nbsp;The car was bent but I could keep going.
&nbsp;I had a few offs as I tried to deal with the bent steering
but pulled off just after the start of the next lap and
retired.</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8348350&amp;custid=59619">
Race 3</a> and I again started 2nd, this time to Andrew Richardson
a fellow Aussie who I've raced with a bunch in the Star Mazda
series. &nbsp;He qualified 0.2 seconds faster than me. &nbsp;Toward
the end of lap one two Corvettes came together at turn 8 and I was
able to take advantage of Andrew slowing down to avoid collision
and took first place. &nbsp;From there I battled, driving on a
knife edge to stay ahead of Andrew. &nbsp;It seemed like he make a
small mistake and drop 1.0s then catch it up in half a lap.
&nbsp;It seemed he had a lot more pace. &nbsp;However, he lost
control on about lap 8 and his race was done as he dropped first
7.5 second back then spun out of the race a few laps later.
&nbsp;Talking just after he spun, he said he was on the ragged edge
too, trying to keep up &nbsp;with me. I wish I knew that earlier
and I wouldn't have sweated so much :) &nbsp;I went on to win the
race by nearly a full lap over 2nd place. &nbsp; My first victory
in the class!</p>

<p><img src="/media/4470/blue_flag_sticker_front_bumper.jpg" width="460" height="258" alt="blueflagslim" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p>

<p>Anyone who's participated in multi-class racing on iRacing knows
the pain of overtaking and being overtaken by cars in another
class, especially when it comes to going a lap down.</p>

<p>I get that the faster car doesn't want to get impeded by the
slower car and is impatient to get by. &nbsp;But also, the slower
car doesn't want to have his race ruined by have to excessively
slow down or go offline to help out the faster car. &nbsp;Respect
and sportsmanship go both ways here. &nbsp;There is an official
stance on this, Blue Flags.</p>

<p>Blue Flags are shown to the car when the car is about to be
lapped. &nbsp;In some real life motorsport categories the blue flag
is not used at all, in others such as F1, ignoring a blue flag will
get you a trip to the stewards. It's in the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does iRacing's official F.I.R.S.T. sporting code have to
say on this matter? &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Section 6.5 - Blue Flag (blue with diagonal yellow
stripe)</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Indicates faster cars are approaching. <strong>This flag is
informational only</strong>. In all cases, it is the responsibility
of the faster car to safely overtake the slower car. It is the
responsibility of the slower car to maintain a consistent line. It
is strongly &nbsp;recommended that a slower car being lapped makes
every reasonable effort to facilitate a safe pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is verbatim from the official rules. &nbsp;Keep in
mind blue flags are only ever shown to a car that is about to be
lapped by another car. &nbsp;Blue flags are not shown when a car in
a faster class is approaching a car in slower class in a fight for
race position.</p>

<p>What does this mean? &nbsp;I'm an MP4-12C driver in the GT
Challenge series, where I'm racing against Corvette ZR-1's in the
same field.</p>

<p><em>In all cases, it is the responsibility of the faster car to
safely overtake the slower car -&nbsp;</em> As a Corvette
approaches to lap me, at about 1.5 seconds out a blue flag is shown
to me, informing me the faster car is close behind.
&nbsp;Officially I need not alter my behaviour at all. &nbsp;The
Corvette must only overtake when it is safe to do so. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the slower car to maintain a
consistent line - As the Corvette approaches me I am maintain my
racing line. &nbsp;I am not to pull off to the side of the track to
allow the Corvette easy and safe passage. &nbsp;I am not to block
the Corvette by altering my line. &nbsp;If I maintain a consistent
line, the Corvette can more accurately assess when it is safe to
overtake, as is their responsibilty made clear in the previous
sentence of the regulations. &nbsp;These are the only two clearly
state responsibilities of the involved parties. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This means if I maintain my line any damage done to me by the
faster Corvette is the fault of the Corvette's. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>It is strongly recommended that a slower car being lapped
make every reasonable effort to facilitate a pass -&nbsp;</em> Note
this is a recommendation. It is not something that must be
undertaken by a car being lapped. &nbsp;Any 'recommendation' falls
under a "sporting" action. &nbsp;As a participant in a sport, and
not be an arsehole, I want to make sure that I don't ruin a
Corvette drivers race by impeding him. &nbsp;Given the two
requirements above - and that the slower car must maintain a
consistent line, the only other action I can take facilitate a safe
pass is to reduce my speed. &nbsp; It's not safe to reduce speed
mid corner, as unexpectedly changing vehicle dynamics may cause
either to car to spin, so that leaves slowing down on straights,
yet staying on-line.</p>

<p>The main take-away from this is that faster cars should approach
a slower car as if blue flags don't exist, and be pleasantly
surprised when a slower car takes action to make it easier for a
faster car to overtake.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><img src="/media/3912/WatkinsGlen-ClassicBoot.JPG" width="500" height="305" alt="WatkinsGlen-ClassicBoot.JPG" style="float: left;"/>Easily a race to forget. &nbsp;Watkins Glen in the
MP4 started positively, with my first (and only) qualifying attempt
outpacing my two teammates that had qualified at that point, and
putting me 36th overall. &nbsp;The Queens birthday public holiday
fell on the Monday of this week, so I had an extra day of racing.
&nbsp;It was my plan to do as many races as possible this weekend.
Partly because I enjoy this track (or I did enjoy it) and partly
because I had the extra time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I set a goal to have by the end of the week: an 2500 iRating
again. &nbsp;Starting at high 2300's, it shouldn't have been that
hard. &nbsp;All I needed to do was finish the races in the top 5
and I'd get an increase in time. &nbsp;I figured I would do about
10 races, so that's only around 15 iRating points increase each
race. &nbsp;Easy, given my apparent speed.</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>Practice started positively. &nbsp;There was no team setup up on
day one so I started with Indianapolis Road and a few tweaks.
&nbsp;I was doing 1:45.5's in the first 30 minutes, good enough for
2nd place in that session. &nbsp;I grabbed the team qualifying
setup on Wednesday (thanks Stephane!) and had at it. &nbsp;1:45.0.
&nbsp;That's pretty decent. &nbsp;The best time I'd seen was a mid
1:44. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I practiced many more times and unfortunately it never got any
faster. &nbsp;I ran my race setup (1 race wing) and was 0.3-0.5s
better than that time on a number of successive laps on Monday, but
every time I'd would put two wheels off-track and get a 1x, even
when I was trying not to. It because very frustrating (so much so
that I pulled over and went to the gym to let off some frustration!
).</p>

<h3>Qualifying and Time Trial</h3>

<p>I qualified on Wednesday night, laying down a 1:44.9. &nbsp;I
made mistake on the next lap, when I was 0.22s up on that time,
giving myself a 1x and invalidating my lap time, but otherwise it
was a good session. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn't qualifying again throughout the weekend. &nbsp;By the
end of the week I was ranked 46th in the world. Still probably my
best qualifying result to date in this series. &nbsp;I took 3 poles
from 10 races this week.</p>

<p>This is also my second week and Time Trials and I did a 1:45.777
average over the 4 laps to put myself 2nd in division 3 and 14th
overall. &nbsp;I've now got 166 points from 2 starts, the highest
average points for division 3. &nbsp;If I had done all 6 trials at
that pace, I'd be leading the division and sitting in 5th
overall!</p>

<p>The numbers pointed to a good weekend.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>Boy was I wrong. &nbsp;Here's my results for the week.</p>

<p><img src="/media/4512/WG-results-mp4.jpg" alt="WG-results-mp4"/></p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8395729&amp;custid=59619">
Race 1</a> was good. &nbsp;I drew some of the fastest MP4 drivers
around, and two team members of Brasa (a Brazilian team) in Renato
Silva and Wendel Parra. &nbsp;My teammate Cyril Rodriguez beat them
both this week, but I was nowhere near their pace. &nbsp;I started
4th on the grid and survived a spin that dropped me down 7th to
finish in 5th. &nbsp;Had I not spun I think I had the pace to beat
WIlliam Trajano into 4th. &nbsp;Either way I'm happy with 5th in
the that field, especially considering the average iRating ahead of
me was 3762 versus my iRating of 2300 at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8396432&amp;custid=59619">
Race 2</a> was not so good. &nbsp;Off the back of the decent
performance in race 1, I hoped to continue to gain iRating in race
2. I was ready on target of 15 iRating or more each race. &nbsp;I
ran around in 2nd place for the first 3 laps, before the pressure
from Anthony Bonner made me push to hard and I lost the rear in the
right hander after the Carousel. &nbsp;As a reult my car was
damaged and I was in last place. &nbsp;I would have stayed last had
not Fernando Avallone crashed with 10 laps to go. &nbsp;I lost 61
iRating</p>

<p>If Race 2 was bad, <a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8397130&amp;custid=59619">
Race 3</a> didn't make up for it. &nbsp;From second on the grid I
was hounded by Jonathan Auger on the opening 5 laps, before letting
him by, as I wasn't making an impression on Warrick Sxpak 2 seconds
in front and Warrick was getting away as I drove to try and defend
from Jonathan. &nbsp;My hope was that by letting Auger past, he
would catch Szpak and slow them both down. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
while he did get very close, he never got close enough to bother
him much and they both pulled away from me. &nbsp;My race was done
when I again lost control and dopped back places. &nbsp;Luckily I
was able to make up a few spots and nearly took 4th position across
the line. &nbsp;I lost 10 iRating and was down to 2274.</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8403151&amp;custid=59619">
Race 4</a> didn't promise a lot. &nbsp;I qualified 8th in a very
strong field and my plan was to cruise around and hope I'd get a
place or two through attrition. Fortunately the MP4 leader didn't
leave enough gap to the Corvettes on the opening lap and a massive
crash at turn 1 took out most of the field! &nbsp;I profitted and
ran up in 2nd place for a few laps, before dropping back to 3rd and
driving for the points. In this 2711 field I collected 126 points!
&nbsp;If the week stopped there I'd have been ok. &nbsp;I made 72
iRating to put me back about where I started the week.</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8404576&amp;custid=59619">
Race 5</a>&nbsp;and my first pole position of the week! &nbsp;Off
the grid it seemed good. &nbsp;I'd likely finish in 2nd or 3rd
place and maybe even win. &nbsp;This race also heralded a bad omen.
&nbsp;Peter Dickson. &nbsp;I can't stand racing the guy. &nbsp;I
first met him in Star Mazda last season and he is the main
contributor to me leaving that series. &nbsp;The guy is a bully on
track and and cursing and swearing bogan in the car. &nbsp;He's one
of the those aggressive drivers that'll leave you no room and will
push his way past then run you off track mid corner.
&nbsp;Basically a prick to race with and makes racing not
enjoyable. &nbsp;He raced with all white MP4, and knew nothing of
rolling starts or multi-class racing, so I can only assume this was
his first foray into the series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As if that wasn't bad enough, I lead the opening lap and left a
7 second gap to the Corvettes. &nbsp;At turn 1 of lap 1 a Corvette
had come off. I came around the Boot on the first lap and a
Corvette appeared to be parked high and dry. &nbsp;He wasn't
parked. He &nbsp;took off exactly at the point I drove past him and
took me straight out of the race and collected 2nd place as well!
&nbsp;Ranked #30 in the field he just drove straight down on the
apex as the MP4 field came around, in a car that was already
ruined. Thank a bunch Tim Allen. Grow a brain! &nbsp;113 iRating
lost (And my nemesis Peter Dickson won the race!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8405233&amp;custid=59619">
Race 6</a> and again I started from pole. &nbsp;This could make up
for some of the damage done last race. &nbsp;Chad Chastian
qualified second, 0.003s behidn me. &nbsp;He's quick. Proper quick,
so I didnt have any dellusions of winning this race, but again, I
could have finished high. &nbsp;I made it through turn 1, but Joe
Junior, the number one Corvette Qualified and #2 ranked driver in
the field decided to start from pits to avoid carnage in the
Corvettes. He came steaming out of the pits and hit me as he tried
to go up my inside into turn 2. &nbsp;I had no idea he was there
and certainly wasn't expecting him, as I battled with Chad, making
sure I left him room on the exit of turn 1 and covered him off
through turn 1. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The hit from Joe put me in the wall and bounced back in front of
Chad and took him out too. &nbsp;127 iRating lost! &nbsp;I was down
to 2016 an things were going from bad to worse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8405821&amp;custid=59619">
Race 7</a>&nbsp;and I neede to make up for the last few races.
&nbsp;I started 3rd behind Warrick Spazk and Corey Osborne. &nbsp;I
didn't think I could take those two guys, but 3rd would have been
fine. &nbsp;Though Chad Chastian was right behind me, so maybe
fourth!</p>

<p>As it turns out, I didn't have to worry too much. &nbsp;I was
running in 4th position, closely behind Corey Osbourne, after Chad
had taken the lead, 12 laps into the race, when I dropped the rear
and broke the car. My race was done and I lost another 60 iRating.
&nbsp;</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8410535&amp;custid=59619">
Race 8</a>&nbsp;and again I started in 8th in a strong field.
&nbsp;I didn't rate my chaces at all. We had a Pro, Teemu Iivonen
off pole, as well as Wendel Parra, and a bunch of other quick
drivers. &nbsp;Parra spun on the opening corner after being pushed
off track by Tanzi. &nbsp;I spun myself out of the race on lap 4.
&nbsp;Another 39 iRating lost and my iRating was down to 2007.
&nbsp;Things were looking dire and the rot had to stop!</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8412719&amp;custid=59619">
Race 9</a>&nbsp;and this needed to be salvation. &nbsp;I started
from pole, a tenth ahead of Stev Buchheim. &nbsp;We pushed hard
from the start, with Stev sitting close behind as we battled.
&nbsp;In the back of my mind I knew I couldn't afford yet another
crash, so when Stev got hooked up behind down the straight, I
didn't put up a fight into the Carousel. &nbsp;I stayed right and
he took the corner. From there it was all about staying on track
and hopefully staying in second place. I did. &nbsp;+65 iRating -
and I had a good converstaion with a bunch of the guys after the
race. &nbsp;Enjoyable.</p>

<p><a
href="http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&amp;subsessionid=8413371&amp;custid=59619">
Race 10</a> and Monday evening. This was it. The game plan was to
get to the end and to gain iRating. Again, Peter Dickson joined the
race. &nbsp;I really hoped this wasn't going to become a habit,
because I just can't stand the guy. &nbsp;I started from 3rd and
before the end of lap one I had Dickson behind me and we were
battling. &nbsp;Again, I knew I couldn't afford to come off the
track, so I ceeded the place. &nbsp;In reality, he was a little
faster than me in this race. &nbsp;I wasn't lapping as well as I
had been in earlier races. &nbsp;Had I been, I may have won the
race, because my fastest ever race lap was a good few tenths faster
than anyone elses, but I could only get within 0.3 of that lap this
race. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After I let Peter by, I made it past him again down the
straight. I suspect he was running a high DF set, as I breezed by
him like he was standing still. &nbsp;Unfortunately a lap later I
made a meal of that same damn corner as usual, the left hander
after the carousel and I spun. &nbsp;This time I didn't hit
anything and recovered just against of Colin Gorton. &nbsp;Just.
&nbsp;We had a good battle for a few laps until I started to pull
away and catch Chris E Pence. &nbsp;I managed to catch and pass
Chris pretty easily but a few more little errors (no incidents)
allowed him to close the few seconds gap I'd pulled. &nbsp;I
started to close in on Brenton Locke in 4th place but had another
moment. &nbsp; I fiished 5th with 16 more iRating points.</p>

<p>This week saw my iRating drop by a net 280 points. &nbsp;My SR
stayed about the same. While my biggest iRating loses were caused
by other drivers hitting me - the two Corvette cases, I still made
far too many mistakes that cost me podium finishes. &nbsp;Pretty
much all of them at the same corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That corner, Chute, turn 6, was my week nemesis. &nbsp;In the
races I did well in I noticed I'd lose between 0.5 and 1.0 each lap
to the cars in front and immediately behind me. &nbsp;I just
couldn't find a way through the turn. It felt awkard to drive and
it seemed my apex was too early, but when I tried to take it
differently I'd lose the back end. &nbsp;A dissappointing weeks
racing.</p>

<p><img src="/media/3617/MidOhio-FullCourse.JPG" width="500" height="315" alt="MidOhio-FullCourse.JPG" style="float: left;"/>This was always going to be a low performing week.
&nbsp;With a family holiday from Friday morning to Sunday
afternoon, track time was going to be restricted. &nbsp;My original
plan was to not race at all...</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>I started practicing on Monday night, in private test sessions.
&nbsp;There were no existing Vortex sets for Mid Ohio so I made do
as best I could, by taking an existing set and modifying it.
&nbsp;My first attempt saw a low 1:22.2. I was in hosted session
that included Dylan Sharman, Australia's top iRacer (by iRating)
and he was doing 1:19.9's. &nbsp;He had two drivers behind him
doing 1:21.3 and a 1:21.9 respectively. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My teammates at Vortex ended up using my setup. Most of them
expressed their dislike for the track. &nbsp;It's not my favourite
track either and a few of the corners can be quite challenging, but
if you know the track it's not too bad, and I've raced here a fair
bit over the years in a number of different cars (Star Mazda, Skip
Barber, and Mustang).</p>

<p>I eventually got my prctice time down to a 1:21.5. &nbsp;I'm not
sure how I managed that though because the closest I could get at
any point there-after was a 1:21.7, though I was on course to
better it a few times. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Qualifying</h3>

<p>Given my decent practice time, I had high hopes for qualifying.
&nbsp;I could only manage a 1:21.8 though. &nbsp;Because of my
restricted time I definitely only had the one opportunity...</p>

<p><img src="/media/4533/midohioq.jpg" alt="Midohioq"/></p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>Because I had Friday off work I tried two races on Thursday
night but both were unofficial. I did the first race and qualified
first out of four cars. Second on the grid was Warrick Szpak, 0.5
second back. He'd beaten me on merit in three out of three races
last week so it was a good benchmark. I pulled away in the first
two laps then maintained a consistent gap. He must have made a
mistake or dropped off because he went from 1.0 behind me to 5.3s
on about lap 4. From there he lost between half and a full second a
lap as I pulled away. I almost kept up with Nick Jongeneelen's
Corvette in front of me, although it was his first race in the
Corvette! I managed a race best time of 1:22.230 and with an
average race time of 1:24.3, which included two stops of around 40
seconds in total. Most of my laps where between 1:22.8 and 1:23.3,
and my tyres held out well until the end. An informative test run
for official races. Excluding the stop, my average race time was a
1:23.0</p>

<p>I got an official race for the 8am race on Friday morning, my
only shot. I qualified 2nd, behind a PRO driver Antoine Higelin.
Annoyingly, from the start my pedals did not work correctly. I'd
put the power down and get a lag in throttle. Kind of a deadspot in
the pedal where I'd get no power. It was distracting enough to
impact on my lap times, as obviously I'd put the power on at a
certain time with the appropriate amount of steering input and the
car would not turn as I expected. As a result my average lap times
were lower. Had I had the same pedal performance as my unofficial
run I would have finished easily in 2nd place, as Antione's average
lap time was a 1:22.622 and Oliver Poetzl in 2nd place was a
1:24.063</p>

<p>My race was effectively ruined by being bundled up behind
Christopher Albers in the Corvette (with an iRating of 1067 :() -
He was slower than me through the corners, missing almost every
apex, yet because of his massive horsepower advantage he was faster
down the straights and would block me in the corners, leaving me
helpless as a queue of Mclarens formed up behind me. Pablo Pohlmann
(iR:3150) was the first to have a go and he pulled up alongside
enough to make the move stick and I left him through. He eventually
came unstuck on the 2nd last turn. Oliver Poetzl sat bottled up
behind me for many laps, lacking the outright speed to get by. He
had a couple of aborted looksup the inside before he got brave into
turn 8 near the end of the race and punted me off the track,
courtesy of a rear end tap. That was me out of 2nd and down to 6th.
I fortunately recovered to 5th when another driver came off.
However, 2nd should have been mine. I was unhappy with the move
Oliver pulled off because it reeked of desparation, and I let him
know as much.</p>

<p><img src="/media/3727/RoadAmerica-Road.JPG" width="500" height="315" alt="RoadAmerica-Road.JPG" style="float: left;"/>In the past, in other series especially the Star
Mazda, I have performed well at Road Ameria. &nbsp;My expectation
was that I'd perform well here again. &nbsp;I guess I ended up
doing ok...</p>

<p>It wasn't that I did poorly, it's just, well, as usual, I could
have done better. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My mindset this week was one of safety and steady collection of
iRating. &nbsp;I went in willing to give away positions to save
gain overall, rather than battling and losing. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>I started the week struggling to get below 2:07.5, which I'd
done on Tuesday. I grabbed a set from my teammates and that helped
a little and I was able to just below and do a 2:06.9 in practice.
I practiced through the rest of the week, including the weekend,
just chipping away, but the fastest guys were doing high 2:04's and
low 2:05's. I struggled on race trim and that was the biggest
worry. 2:07's were hard to come-by. Whereas my teammates were often
dipping into the low 2:07's. I practiced a bunch with race fuel but
it didn't make a whole lot of difference.</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>I did the one session and pounded around getting faster and
faster until I scored a 2:06.754. I tried another 2 laps but didn't
get any quicker, making a few small mistakes instead.</p>

<p><img src="/media/5432/qra.jpg" alt="MP4-s2013w8-q"/></p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p>Race 1 was interesting. I qualified 5th and my thinking was that
I'd cruise around and collect some points, with Wendel Parra ahead
and the crazy Diego Rancano Boudon nearby, as well as a few other
drivers higher ranked than me starting behind me. &nbsp;I got away
ok and fortunately, Boudon, being the knob-globbler that his is (<a
href="/{localLink:1248}" title="Respected Racers">yes I don't like
him</a>) jumped ahead before the race proper got underway, by way
of going faster than is polite in behind the pace car and before
the lights went green after the pace car pulled off. &nbsp;He
charged through two places but collided with 3rd place Julien
Deroche on lap 3, setting Deroche back to the pits for 2 laps,
while he only managed to recover 2 seconds behind me, now in 4th.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boudon was looking like pushing past so I let him past early and
as I did that Paul Darling got by too. &nbsp;I spent the rest of
the race with 3.0s of Darling, and sometimes as low as 0.3s!</p>

<p>True to forth, the dangerous Boudon collided with Wendel Parra
near the closing stages of the race and now I was in third place.
At the time I was 0.4 behind Darling and the distraction cost me
over two seconds, as the two ranted at each other over voice.
&nbsp;I caught up behind Darling on the last lap and was in with a
shot. On the last corner he ran wide, but I wasn't paying too much
attention, and forgot to shift down another gear. &nbsp;As a
result, I ran wide (I realised but too late) and my exit was
comprised. &nbsp;In the end we were 0.2 seconds apart as we crossed
the line. &nbsp;I was happy with 3rd and I scored my highest ever
points haul.</p>

<p>Race 2 should have been mine. &nbsp;I qualified on pole, with
Stev Buchheim behind me, but 0.4 back. &nbsp;He got racey as the
race started and tapped my rear left into turn 1. That cost him a
bit of time and he lost two places, retiring a few laps later
(though not through the contact with me). &nbsp; I quickly pulled
3.0 seconds on 2nd and 3rd as I caught the Corvettes in front, with
4 seconds to them. &nbsp;Then disaster for them and they collided.
&nbsp;With only two Vettes in the field I was left leading the race
outright for the first time! &nbsp;I got 5 laps in before I put
myself out. &nbsp;I was watching the gap back to Larry Smith in
2nd, and despite me pulling a gap early on, I was unable to pull
after the two Vettes collided and I had to come to a near stop to
miss them as they flipped through the air. &nbsp;I decided to push.
&nbsp;The first corner after my brain said "push", my back end hit
a curb and I was off, spinning down the grassy hill. &nbsp;I
recovered though, in third but I never got another look in at the
win. &nbsp;I at least gained 4 seconds on the leader between that
point and the end of the race, and 14 seconds on 2nd place. &nbsp;I
should have won.</p>

<p>Race 3 and I was in a strong field. &nbsp;Looking at the grid I
was 5th but I decided 8th would be good enough (out of 11). Off the
line I got away strong and we front running 5 cars pulled a 6
second gap back to 6th quickly. &nbsp;The leader, Manu Heikkila,
who averages 32 races a week since joining 3 months ago, spun off
and I was up in 4th and then 3rd. He came back at me quickly and I
went to let him through before he tagged me off and I lost 24
seconds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I was making my way solidly back up through the field, closing
in on 6th through to 4th, when I came across a spun 6th position
car. &nbsp;We collided and my race was done while he drove off.</p>

<p>On both occasions, neither driver said sorry, even though
certianly in the second case he was most definitely at fault.
&nbsp;That annoys me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been looking foward to my home race all season.
&nbsp;Finally, with week 9, the GT Challenge series arrived at
Phillip Island.</p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>Even though I started practice here on Tuesday, I didn't get a
chance to practice as much as I'd have liked, because I raced in
the Grand Am event on Thursday, so I practiced for taht on
Wednesday and Thursday, leaving my only practice for Friday night.
&nbsp;There also was no Vortex setup, so I made my own. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I managed a 1:29.9 on Tuesday but Aaron Heap was doing 1:28.6's
and my teammates managed 1:29.1's in Qualifying. &nbsp;By the end
of the week my PB was a 1:29.4 with an opt of 1:28.8 and a few
times I was up on my opt near the end before coming off. &nbsp;I
went to bed late Friday night confident of a good setup for the
race and qualifying.</p>

<p>I also put in a few hours of practice between Race 1 and Race 2,
trying to find out what went wrong.</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>After a late Friday night on setup work I woke on Saturday with
only 5 hours sleep and was a lot tired. &nbsp;The best lap I could
manage was a 1:30.0 and that was with my Tuesday setup. The setup
that worked so well the night before could barely keep me on track.
It felt terrible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Monday night I did Time Trials and for that I changed my setup
by stiffening the front springs. That gave me an immediately better
feel and I turned a 1:29.2. I then did the 7:30pm qualifying
session and turned a couple of 1:29.8's to improve on my 1:30.0.
&nbsp;I didn't do any more races though, so it was moot.</p>

<p><img src="/media/5499/PI-Q-2013s2.jpg" alt="PI-Q-2013s2"/>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p>Race 1, What a distaster. &nbsp;I qualified on pole by a few
tenths and was ranked #5, with #6 in 2nd. &nbsp;He shadowed me for
the first 10 laps and I couldn't really shake him. I was taking it
easy and the only time I could get a gap up was when he'd make a
mistake, and then he'd close up again. &nbsp;I was lappig a
terribly slow GT car when I messed it up and went off track,losing
the lead and 6 seconds. From there it just got worse as I struggled
to stay on track. I was running Hard brake pads and I think that
was part of my problem. &nbsp;I was also pretty physically tired
from a lack of sleep thanks to working on setup the night
before.</p>

<p>I spent most of Saturday following Race 1 feeling down.
&nbsp;The more I practiced the worse I got, to the point where I
couldn't even set a completely mistake free lap! &nbsp;I gave up
and went and watched a movie, resigning myself to not racing the
rest of the day. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The movie watched and coffee consumed I was feeling a bit better
and I couldn't let it end there. &nbsp;I had to solve this
performance problem, be it setup or the way I was driving. &nbsp;I
decided to enter the 4pm race and just cruise around, collecting
what points I could.</p>

<p><img src="/media/5519/PI-WIN.png" width="800" height="301" alt="PI-WIN"/></p>

<p>To my surprise I started from pole, with the other 7 Mclarens in
the field not setting a time. &nbsp;Though right behind me in 2nd
place was non other than Shane Van Gisbergen, V8supercar superstar
- from the real seires, not the iRacing version. &nbsp;I knew I
wasn't going to beat him so I let him go on the start - or rather
he made a cracking start and was gone. &nbsp;He pulled away at an
average of nearly 1.0 seconds a lap while I fought with a host of
drivers. First Zoltan Herczeg had was behind, but couldnt' keep it
on track, then Nigel Baines came up close, but he too dropped back
in spurts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On lap 16 Van Gisbergen dropped his right rear off the track and
was into the wall and out of the race and I was into the lead.
&nbsp;I led the remaining 14 laps to my second victory of the
season, making up for my mistakes in the first race. &nbsp;This
race was also very strange in that only myself and Nigel finished.
&nbsp;The other 6 drivers all crashed out.</p>

<p>It was cool though, to sit behind SVG and watch his lines.
&nbsp;They weren't much different but I did pick a few little
points up. &nbsp;It's just cool for a motorsport fan to be in the
same race, and to be the position behind, someone as fast in both
real life and virtual racing :)</p>

<p>I've been playing world of trucks for a while now. &nbsp;While
at first I was skeptical I'd enjoy it, I've found it to be really
great fun. &nbsp;So much so I wrote a review. &nbsp;One of my
points was how cool it would be to have multiplayer. &nbsp;Of
course, I'm not along in this desire and SCS, the makers of ETS2,
have listened and are about to release a patch to grant multiplayer
access.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today we would like to present you with a microscopic glimpse
into what we hinted earlier - our long standing devotion to Euro
Truck Simulator 2 evolution.</p>

<p>World of Trucks's ultimate goal is creating an environment where
you - our community - can meet, interact and compete with each
other in the expansive trucking world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;It's only in Alpha but this is very promising. &nbsp;I
can't wait to get online with my mates and truck around Europe
:D</p>

<p><img src="/media/3852/Suzuka-GrandPrix.JPG" width="454" height="291" alt="Suzuka-GrandPrix.JPG" style="float: left;"/>Suzuka is a story of nearly but not quite. &nbsp;A
place where I made a few too many mistakes that cost me valuable
points.</p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>After the problems at Phillip Island Suzuka got off to a good
start. &nbsp;I was immediately faster than the few drivers who were
significantly faster than me at Phillip Island on day 1 of
practice. &nbsp; I was turning 2:02.1's &nbsp;after the first hour
of practice. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cyril R shared his setup on the team forums and tried that going
forward from Wednesday, with my fastest pratice lap being a
2:01.765, still a way down on Cyril and Christrians though. &nbsp;I
set that time on the Wednesday and didn't better it all week.
&nbsp;There wasn't anything that felt horribly wrong with my car
and I did get my optimal down to 2:00.7, I just couldn't string a
full lap together at near that pace. &nbsp;I came close a number of
times but lost it in either the hairpain (turn 11) or through Spoon
(turn 13).</p>

<h4>Qualifying &amp; Time Trial</h4>

<p>I think qualifying went ok. My fastest lap was looking at being
almost sub 2:01, but again, I made a mess of it, I think through
Spoon. &nbsp;I ended up with a 2:01.509.</p>

<p><img src="/media/5648/Suzi_Q.jpg" alt="Suzi_Q"/></p>

<p><img src="/media/5653/Suzi_TT.jpg" alt="Suzi_TT"/></p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p><strong>Race 1</strong> definitely did not live up to the hype.
&nbsp;I started from 2nd on the grid, behind Japanese driver
Takafumi Ichikawa, whom I've race a bit but not that often so I
figured he's probably here because it's a Japanese track and he's
Japanese, rather than to continue his championship, like most of
us. &nbsp;Close behind me was Manu Heikkila, who after pushing me
off at Road America, is not my favourite driver. &nbsp;Honestly the
way he drives makes me nervous, which usually means I crash.
&nbsp;Ironic, because I'm nervous about him crashing into me, so I
crash myself out.</p>

<p>Anyway, we parade around and out of the hairpin I'm ahead of
Takafumi and I back off, so I don't take the lead when I shouldn't.
&nbsp;He's going VERY slow. Then he gasses it up and by the time
I've reacted Manu has gone through as well, right behind him and
I'm third. &nbsp;I had more speed than Manu in the race and
probably enough to take Takafumi, but I dropped it at Spoon and put
myself 5 laps down. &nbsp;BThe best I could manage was 6th place,
the last of the finishers. &nbsp;Still, only 2 incidents, so my SR
went up.</p>

<p><strong>Race 2</strong> and I hoped Race 1 would be erased by a
good result here. &nbsp;Again I was 2nd on the grid, with Manu
directly behind me, 2 places back. &nbsp;I made a decent start and
was running close behind Stefan when on the 2nd lap I came unstuck
on turn 7. &nbsp;I limped back to the pits but was many laps down
when I came out and my car was undriveable. &nbsp;I retired.
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 3&nbsp;</strong> and surely this had to be better.
I started 4th, behind 3rd place Takafumi, with Manu 2 places behind
me. &nbsp;I got away solidly. &nbsp;Nigel Baines made a cracking
start from pole to pull ahead of the three cars behind him that
included me. &nbsp;We battled closely and there was nothing in it.
&nbsp;Nigel had an off and we went past, with him rejoining in 4th
place. &nbsp;The lap later I spun and Nigel collected me. &nbsp;He
retired and I kept going, with a slightly bent car, eventually
rcovering to finish 5th after closing the gap to the top four
drivers. &nbsp;At least my fastest lap was faster than the four in
front. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 4</strong> and I qualified 4th with the superfast
Chad Chastian off pole. &nbsp;I didnt' expect much here. &nbsp;I
was right behind Takafumi off 3rd. &nbsp;I'm not sure what happened
but Chad must have fell off pretty early (he retired on lap 12),
because for most the race it was me sitting less than 0.5s from
Takafumi's rear wing. &nbsp;I lacked the pace to overtake and it
seemed whenever he made a small mistake I would do the same.
&nbsp;All in all it was a great fun battle, with the intensity
reflected in how close our fastest laps were (0.009s apart in
favour of Takafumi). &nbsp;Takafumi made a mistake on the 3rd last
lap coming out of Spoon. I tried to capitalise but I took ran wide
and lost 2.0s. &nbsp;From there I knew I wouldn't be able to pass
again, even if I managed to get hooked back up to his rear wing
before the race was done. &nbsp;I instead slowed down to a cruise,
with 30 seconds back to 3rd place there was little change I'd
finish anywhere but 2nd. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Race 5</strong>&nbsp;was a huge field in terms of pace.
&nbsp;I qualified 7th and it looks like this time Manu requalified
because he started one position ahead of me. &nbsp;I made a decent
start but then Manu ran wide into the hairpin on the first lap and
I swerved to miss him as he rejoined. &nbsp;We touched, with me
getting a 0x but the touch allowed the car behind me to take the
spot. &nbsp;A few laps later I spun myself around at Spoon and
narrowly avoided collecting another car as rejoined the track, but
I was back in 2nd last. &nbsp;One of the front runners disconnected
with 6 laps to go and I managed to overtake the very erratic
Leandro S Schmidt for 7th place before the end, but only because he
lost control exiting the final corner of the final lap.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a
href="http://www.iracing.com/bucket-list/">latest iRacing blog
post</a>, here is my real life motorsport bucket list - the
motorsport events I realistically want to see before I kick the
bucket.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bathurst 1000</strong> (nearly made it in 2010. &nbsp;I
had tickets and everything!) - The biggest and best touring car
race, make that sedan race, in the world. &nbsp;For closed wheel
cars, in my mind there's nothing bigger. And the atmosphere!</li>

<li><strong>Phillip Island MotoGP</strong> - Meca for the Aussie
bike fan. If only I got to see Casey Stoner work his majic around
here.</li>

<li><strong>Daytona 500</strong> (Yes, NASCAR is in this list) -
Days of Thunder. &nbsp;What an experience.</li>

<li><strong>Le Mans 24 hours</strong> - Worlds toughest endurance
event. I'd love to go with mates and spend the day just talking
cars while watching the race and there's 24 hours to do it</li>

<li><strong>British F1 Grand Prix at Silverstone</strong> - For the
environment of the F1 mad british</li>

<li><strong>Belgium F1 Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps</strong> -
For the track that is widely regarded as the best in the world, and
to see Eu Rogue</li>

<li><strong>Japanese F1 Grand Prix at Suzuka</strong> - For part
the track and part the crazy Japanese Fans. &nbsp;More the track
through.</li>

<li><strong>Monaco F1 Grand Prix</strong> - Oh the sound of F1 cars
around here, engine notes bouncing off the buildings.</li>

<li><strong>Indianapolis 500</strong> - The speed and tight
confines. &nbsp;I'm not so much interested in Indycar but it's a
big event</li>

<li><strong>Any European round of the WRC</strong> - Crazy guys in
close quarters. &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Goodwood Festival of Speed</strong> - Nothing but
petrol heads of the highest calibre here. A chance to see may
different types of cars over the years.</li>

<li><strong>A major motorshow in either Britian, France, Germany or
maybe the US.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Isle of Man TT -&nbsp;</strong> worlds most crazy bike
riders.</li>
</ul>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;"><span style="font-size: 1em;"><img src="/media/3742/RoadAtlanta-Full.JPG" width="475" height="304" alt="RoadAtlanta-Full.JPG" style="float: left;"/></span></span></p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>The week started strong. I took my Suzuka setup and changed it
just slightly and did a few laps and was immediately fast, posting
a low 1:20.3 in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did a few practice sessions more during the week, particularly
on Wednesday with Anthony and Cyril from Vortex and Iw as
consistently faster than both of them. &nbsp;Although I think
neither were familiar with Road Atlanta, so it was only a matter of
time before they got faster. &nbsp;Something I never did.</p>

<p>Aaron Heap set a 1:19.7 in practice, and shared his set, so I
grabbed that and on Thursday started playing with it and managed to
get my time down to a 1:20.1 and then a 1:20.0 while following a
faster driver (tow) which gave me a 4km/hr boost down the
straight.</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>Given my initial strong practice I qualified on Tuesday night
and immediately set the fastest time in the world at that point.
Small thing though and by the end of the week I'd be nowhere in the
overall standings and Patrick Valente Ferro would have posted a
1:18.477, some 1.7 seconds faster than my best of 1:20.121 (52nd in
the world)</p>

<p><img src="/media/5757/RAt_Q_.jpg" alt="RAt_Q"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time Trial was a little better. I managed a 1:20.7 average which
on my 2nd run. &nbsp;The first run was terrible (1:21.4 avg) due to
not having my load cell set correctly. Once fixed, my times dropped
to what I expected. &nbsp;It was good enough to put me well clear
at the top of Division 3 (my division) by over a second, and to put
me 6th overall.</p>

<p><img src="/media/5752/RAt_TT.jpg" alt="RAt_TT"/></p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p><strong>Race 1</strong> was a disaster. &nbsp;I got up for the
6am race, hoping to race with my French teammates. &nbsp;I made the
topsplit but didn't qualify highly. &nbsp;I was too tired to keep
focused and my race became a litany of mistakes before I pulled
over and retired and went to work. &nbsp;I just couldn't get my
foot to come smoothly off the brake and as a result I kept losing
the back end. Not cool.</p>

<p><strong>Race 2</strong> was not a whole lot better. I got away
ok but was touched coming up the hill after turn 1. The touch bent
my suspension but at least the car that moved across on me (Nikos)
took out three cars behind me when he came off. &nbsp;I left room
for him to come up the inside on turn one and I kept my speed up
the hill and was just ahead into turn 2, which is barely a turn. I
knew the car to my right would either have to yield to make turn 3
or he'd go off. He moved left to take the turn, and touched me
slightly enough to put bend my steering and make the car handle
poorly for the rest of the race, and I lost about 1.5 seconds a
lap. &nbsp;He though came off the track and three other cars
following close behind hit him ruining all their races. &nbsp;From
the replay it looked like he didn't see me there and certainly I
couldn't see me on my center screen when in his car, so if he only
had once screen and wasn't running a super high FOV (unlikely) he'd
have not know I was there. &nbsp;Racing incident, oh well...</p>

<p><strong>Race 3</strong> and I was on pole by 0.6s in a huge
field of 35 cars and I think 23 Mclarens. &nbsp;Problem was I was
doing development work on a fuel calculator just prior and was
using my Xbox controller and had auto gears and brake and throttle
assists turned on and forgot to turn them off. &nbsp;As a result I
was terribly slow off the line and about 4 seconds off my pace (of
mid 1:20's) until I got used to the car. &nbsp;By then I was down
in 5th place, where I stayed for the remained of the race.</p>

<p><strong>Race 4</strong>&nbsp;was better. This time I started
from 2nd place, with 1st just 0.2s ahead on pole. &nbsp;I made a
decent start and first pulled away easily so I settled into 2nd
place and trying to stay ahead of Trevor Forester. &nbsp;We battled
really well all race, with less than 1.0s between us until he spun
on the exit of turn 5 and lost 7 seconds. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/5762/RAt_R.jpg" alt="RAt _R"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More annoyingly, I was registered for other races during the
week that didn't go official. &nbsp;I disconnected from the last 2
before the race began and d/c'd from the first one after I made a
mistake (3x). &nbsp;Each race had 9 drivers, so was so close.
&nbsp;One more driver in any class and I've scored some good points
and good iRacing. Note the SOF</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Meyers has just published the release notes for latest
build, set to drop at the start of next week, July 23rd.&nbsp; The
summary is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lotus 49 on the NTMv5 (New Tyre Model version 5)</li>

<li>Montreal circuit (Gilles Villeneuve)</li>

<li>Ghost car with 5 different modes</li>

<li>Head Mechanic role who can modify your car setup</li>

<li>Variable weather in hosted and test sessions (still no
rain)</li>

<li>Other big fixes and tweaks to various cars including NTMv5 on
the Skip Barber car and Street Stock</li>

<li>Tech Tracks (draft releases of tracks)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other cool features too, mainly for leagues, but I
don't think that will impact many racers, as most who do compete in
private leagues seem to use software personalised to each league
(see omr.com.au for example).</p>

<p>A ghost car is now included.&nbsp; iRacing call this the
'<strong>reflap car</strong>'.&nbsp; While the ghost car features
seem out of place in a true simulation, ghosts provide an excellent
way to analyse your own best lap, as far as driving lines and
braking points are concerned.</p>

<p>Variable Weather has been introduced to hosting sessions. This
is a major thing for iRacing, as it was previously big complaint
point from members.&nbsp; Note it's not rain effects, just variable
temperature and fog. It's getting close though</p>

<p>The team features are pretty cool.&nbsp; Previously "crew
chiefs" could change your black box information.&nbsp; Now team
members can adjust your car setup while it's in the garage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This build introduces the ability for your teammates to help out
with setting up your car in<br />
 the garage. Apply whatever term fits your mental model for this;
possibly "head mechanic",<br />
 though internally we call this person the "garage editor". As with
the crew chief, any of<br />
 your teammates can take-on and give-up the garage editor role at
will, but only one person may<br />
 claim that role at any given time.<br />
 You can envision visiting the garage screen as picking up a
clipboard that has the team's<br />
 setup sheet on it. In order to make any changes, you need to
request that you become the<br />
 team's "garage editor", and that the team's car be physically put
into the garage, where the<br />
 mechanics can flail away at it with tools, and the effects of any
updates can be measured.<br />
 You do this by clicking the green "edit" icon near the upper-right
corner of the garage<br />
 screen. If you are the only person on your team that is connected
to the session, the "edit"<br />
 button is automatically clicked for you. If the icon is gray, then
the car is forbidden from<br />
 being placed into the garage (generally after a race session
starts).<br />
 While the car is in the garage, the [Drive] button on the session
screen will be disabled, and<br />
 will be shown as [Garage], instead. The helmet and name of the
person that is adjusting the<br />
 car is displayed on the garage screen to all the team's members.
All of the teammates can see<br />
 the changes the garage editor is making to the car's setup each
time the setup finishes "tech<br />
 inspection". Many changes tech quickly and are automatically sent,
but some require the<br />
 [Apply] button to be clicked, or for the [Apply] to be
automatically executed.<br />
 All changes to the team's car setup are tentative, and will only
be committed when the garage<br />
 editor clicks the garage screen's [Done] button. Clicking on this
button relinquishes the<br />
 garage editor role, and physically releases the team's car from
the garage with the latest<br />
 changes applied to it. The garage editor can discard any changes
they've made and revert to<br />
 the team's car as it entered the garage by clicking [Cancel], the
"edit" icon, or [X] to close<br />
 the garage screen, and then confirming that the changes are to be
thrown away. Discarding the<br />
 changes from having clicked the "edit" icon or the [X] will also
give up the garage editor<br />
 role.</p>

            <tags><![CDATA[iRacing,Lotus 49]]></tags>
            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>It's been a long time coming. &nbsp;The Lotus 49 was announced
last year and was due to be in the season 1 build for 2013.
&nbsp;It didn't make that build, with Dave Krammer, it's main
creator wanting to perfect the physics before release.</p>

<p><img src="/media/6083/250px-Grand_Prix_Legends_Coverart.jpg" width="100" height="116" alt="Grand Prix Legends" style="float: left;"/>For those not iRacing mad (those poor
poor boring souls). &nbsp;Dave made his name on Grand Prix Legends
(well, really made his name there). &nbsp;Some, nay many, consider
GPL to be the first real sim. &nbsp;Unfortunately for me I'd just
started Uni when it debutted when I was brain deep in serious
tertiary education, from which I didn't emerge until many years
later. &nbsp; I heard about GPL but given my
<strong>addiction</strong> to Geoff Crammands Grand Prix series
through the early and mid 90's and my early highschool, I thought
it best I don't get distracted. &nbsp;Wikipedia (for all it's
worthlessness) even says "is considered by many people to be on tof
the most realistic racing games ever released". &nbsp;</p>

<p>With that in mind, it's understandable why Dave felt the Lotus
49 in iRacing, the current "Best racing game of all time" (as voted
by gamers and journalists) should be mint. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The car was delayed again for Season 2 2013, but finally it is
here. And let me tell you it is brilliant but very difficult to
drive. &nbsp;It move about on the road like nothing else. &nbsp;If
you stab at the throttle it'll power oversteer you into a firey
virtual death. If you are abrubt on the brakes you'll lock the
wheels and either have the back come round on you or slide off the
track. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way to drive this car is with smooth inputs. &nbsp;It was
tyriple world champion Jackie Stewart, who drove Formula 1 during
the Lotus 49 period, who described driving like there's an egg
under the throttle. &nbsp;He also famously related that we should
never get on the throttle until we intended to not get off it.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've spent about an hour so far acclimatising to the madness and
joy of this vehicle and this is all I've got to show for it.</p>

<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoheight=""
aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0" videowidth=""
macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="dsc3Q2VXoiM" />


<p>When I logged into iRacing this morning there were approximately
4500 people online. In my 2.5 years of iRacing I've never seen so
many people online at once. And another first, every Lotus 49
practice session was near capacity. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that the car is finally here and we can stop asking about
it's arrival and complaining of it's tardiness in turning up in our
garages, we are all very excited. &nbsp;Now if only the other
drivers would stay on track and give me a clean lap.</p>

<p>Enough of this, I'm off to get some more practice in!</p>

            <tags><![CDATA[iracing,Grand Am]]></tags>
            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>With a new season now started I have set forth some goals and
hopefully a way forward with my performance.</p>

<p>Last season I competed in the GT challenge series, where
Corvettes CR6's were pitted against Mclaren MP4-12C's and Ford
GT's. &nbsp;This season iRacing has (correctly) dropped the GT
Challenge series, leaving a single series for each of those three
makes. While the Corvette and Ford will race the GT Prototype
series with the Honda HPD, the Mclaren will race in the Grand Am
series with the Riley Prototype cars. &nbsp;I think this is a much
better solution, as it should ensure enough numbers in each.
&nbsp;Mclaren being by far the most popular car of all those
mentioned.</p>

<p>The Grand Am series also streams the Thursday 8:45pm SOF race in
Australia. Meaning there's always a large turnout and multiple
splits. This is good for me as it means I can get my main racing
done before the weekend, even if it does mean I am a little
under-prepared.</p>

<p>After my rookie season in the MP4-12C last season I have
identified some points where I'd like to improve. &nbsp;Some I
gained from reading Ross Bentley's speed secrets and others I
observed on myself after numerous races.</p>

<p><strong>Things I do well</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Qualify and lay down quick laps. &nbsp;While not the fastest, I
generally qualifying in the top 3 and my practices times are
good.</li>

<li>Leave appropriate racing room for other drivers. &nbsp;</li>

<li>Develop a stable setup.</li>

<li>Let drivers who are clearly faster go past me as soon as
practicle.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem Areas</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I don't drive a defensive enough line during races. &nbsp;This
encourages other drivers to basically bombdive me, thanks to my
preference for late apexes making it look like I've left an
opening. &nbsp;I need to decisively show the driver behind there is
no chance to come through cleanly.</li>

<li>Race nerves are a huge problem for me. &nbsp;I struggle to keep
my hands and feet from shaking me off the track when starting in a
field I know will be difficult, or when there are drivers around my
speed nearby.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides generally being not fast enough, the above two problem
areas are the main things keeping my iRating low. &nbsp;I'll build
up iRating only to have it brought crashing back down again.
&nbsp;I would really like to have a smaller gap between my average
qualifying position and my average race position. &nbsp;It's likely
the two will never be equal, given a DNF can sometimes mean I
finish a race in 20th or worse position, really ruining the
average. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the key to bringing these two average closer together is
to run a "race line" that is different than my "qualifying line"
when there are cars near me. &nbsp;At least on turn in.
&nbsp;Nerves can be reduced by lowering expectations. &nbsp;I have
qualified high up in some big races but I didn't rate myself and
thus my nerves were lower. &nbsp;I need to not go into every race
thinking it's my right to finish in the top few positions. &nbsp;
At least not for a while. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/3727/RoadAmerica-Road.JPG" width="500" height="315" alt="RoadAmerica-Road.JPG" style="float: left;"/>I had a little more time to practice / race this
week, as I had all week off work. &nbsp;I began practicing on
Wednesday and actually qualified and raced that day, doing the
12:45 and 2:45 pm races.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think I did two practice sessions this week, as I already know
this track and go well here. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>My initial qualifying attempt of 2:07.7 was very ordinary, but
it was enough to keep getting me pole positions until I requalified
on Thursday evening. &nbsp;I did a record 5 qualifying sessions
this week, as a strove for a time I knew I was capable of. &nbsp;By
Thursday night I had qualified with a 2:06.244, a time which at the
time put be 21st overall. &nbsp;And almost always good enough for
pole. &nbsp; The time ultimately put me 30th, the fastest of the
Vortex drivers :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Time Trial</h4>

<p><img src="/media/6282/road_america_time_trial_yay.png" width="500" height="60" alt="Road_america_time_trial_yay"/><br />
<br />
 I had two time trial attempts too, and this is where I did very
well. &nbsp;I ended up with the
fastest&nbsp;<strong>overall</strong>&nbsp;time trial time, even
though I made errors on two laps, by way of setting a 2:06.200 on
my opening lap and then two more laps under 2:07.00</p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p>Over the week I did 9 races, with a fantastic 5 wins from 7 pole
positions. &nbsp;What did I do differently this week? &nbsp;I think
it's the race start time. &nbsp;It's almost certainly that. I was
home off work this week and could race during the day. The splits
at that time were a good bit lower than my usual splits of
1800-1900, coming in at about 1500-1600. &nbsp;Combined with my
great qualifying time meant I was starting from pole often and
could make the break early on and hold it.</p>

<p>I started the opening race from pole, and on the second lap
Thomas Pendergrass came to make a move on me. &nbsp;Being a long
race, I braked early and let him through, but he lost it on the
exit of the corner and veered right and into me, then the out of
place Riley behind me hit me in the rear and I was out of the
race.</p>

<p>I won race 2 easily. &nbsp;In race 3 I qualified 2nd with Manu
Heikkila on pole and Anthony Bonner behind me. &nbsp;I made a
mistake on the last corner of the warm up lap and went wide, givin
the spot to Anthony. &nbsp;From there I got stuck battling with a
DP who couldn't drive. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6TsFulrUxU"></a>I won
Race 4 at a canter, by over a minute from 2nd place Jack
Veletanlic.</p>

<p>Race 5 was a strong race and I qualified 4th (would have been
2nd with my time from later in the day!) There was some crazyness
at the end of the warm up lap and myself and 5th place spun out.
&nbsp;I could have stayed left more, but it was close as to who
caused that one. &nbsp;2nd and 3rd also came together in the same
way on the same corner, right in front (which may have contributed
to our accident). &nbsp;From there there was a whole bunch of fail
that made the race interesting, as various drivers dropped out. I
ended up 4th overall anyway...</p>

videourl="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-loeUXnc6bI"
videoheight="" aspectratio="" allowfullscreen="0"
videowidth="" macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer"
videoid="" /> 

<p>I won Race 6 by about 25 seconds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Race 7 I finished 2nd to Joel Tremblay in a race I should have
won. &nbsp;I led from pole but he nailed it out of the last turn on
the formation lap and was past me before we crossed the line. From
there I sat behind him for the first few laps before I slid off and
hit the wall on the exit of the final turn. &nbsp;I recovered in
5th and made my way back to 2nd place, closing to within 3 seconds
of Joel before losing it again, my car not handling the best. I
rejoined 12 seconds back and closed back in to within 6 seconds,
with 5 laps to go, I would have got him, then I came off again, and
cruised to the end.</p>

<p>I won a very intense Race 8. &nbsp;I started from pole with Joel
in second place. &nbsp;Remembering the last time we met, I covered
the line and got on the throttle early and kept the lead. &nbsp;We
were a second or so apart for a few laps but I manged to pull 0.5s
a lap pretty consistently. I ran a near perfect race, missing I
think only 2 apexes the entire race. By the end I soaked with
sweat, my glasses were fogging, and I was elated. I had a chat with
Joel after and he was the same, he said he gave it everything he
had and was exhausted :D &nbsp;Great race.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to race again but I decidede to jump on for a
final race on Sunday evening. I again started from pole with a big
gap to 2nd place according to the qualifying times. &nbsp;Naruko
Ishida pushed me hard at the start but eventually my consistency
prevailed as I pulled away a bit at a time each lap. &nbsp;I
finished the race about 9 seconds clear of the eventual second
place driver, Johnnie Jones. &nbsp;Another hard fought and
satisfying win.</p>

      <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>Ragged Racing is my motorsport blog. &nbsp;I'm a big fan of
simracing, in particular iRacing, as well as a fan of real world
Formula 1 and V8Supercars. &nbsp;I also play a number other sim
driving games.</p>

<h3>Sim Racing History</h3>

<p>My love of Formula 1 and sim racing dates back to Accolades
Grand Prix, which also got me interested in the real Formula 1.
&nbsp;It all started age 12, with my friends and I, trying to
out-do one another on that game in our lunch time of Grade 8 at our
local highschool. &nbsp;We'd all go and play on the
monochrome-green 8086 computers in our schools' lab. &nbsp;I wanted
to win so I practice on my grandmothers PC on weekends and during
the holidays (we didn't have our own) and soon I was fastest.</p>

<p>While I played Geoff Crammonds entire Grand Prix series
(Microprose), I attribute Grand Prix 2 as the defining game of,
well, I guess my life. &nbsp;I played Grand Prix 2 every day after
school. &nbsp;I'd spend extensive time just turning practice lap
after lap, collecting data to analyse in the games telemetry
viewer. &nbsp;I downloaded packs and hacks and addons from the
Internet. &nbsp;Back then it was still just keyboard too. &nbsp;It
wasn't until Grand Prix 3 that I got my first wheel.</p>

<p>I took a long break from sim-racing in the late 1990's and
through the 2000's as I completed highschool, went to uni (two
undergraduate degrees, a half finished post-graduate degree, and a
diploma) and established my career. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I wanted to return to sim-racing but I was waiting for a title
that would give me a similar experience to Microprose Grand Prix.
&nbsp;I had a played with Live for Speed and rFactor but didn't
have the time to invest (and I spent nearly 7 years playing World
of Warcraft as my sole game). &nbsp;When I heard Codemasters was
about to release F1 2010 I ponied up for a new pc and racing wheel
(Logitech G27) and went racing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I raced in a F1 201x league for versions F1 2010 and F1 2011,
and someone in that league put me onto iRacing in early 2011.
&nbsp;I immediately fell in love with the feel of the cars, even
though I was only racing the Mazda MX-5/Miata. &nbsp;But I was
committed to my F1 201x league, maintaining the website, recording
scores, etc and iRacing was only fallback, for a quick thrash
between seasons of the league I was in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Early 2012 I exitted the F1 201x league (admittedly acrimonously
but at least it meant there was no way back - and that's what I
wanted, to focus on my next step of sim racing). &nbsp;I started
poking around the iRacing site more and found out how championships
and seasons work, how points are scored and all that stuff.
&nbsp;Before this I never even knew points were tallied toward a
season champion!</p>

<p>Now I'm all in and iRacing is a fantastic platform for virtual
racing and competing. &nbsp;Near as perfect as it can get online
(yes, the physics can be further improved - but as an overall
platform - awesome).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been on the lookout for a cockpit to hopefully improve my
times, but definitely improve my overall enjoyment.&nbsp; I toyed
with the idea of getting a model with an inbuilt seat but there's
both the high price and the size factor.&nbsp; I've got an L shaped
desk and I had just been clamping my G27 wheel and gear stick to
that, with the carpet providing some resistance to nearly hold my
pedals in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn't quite work though and often during a racing I'll be
trying to drag the pedals back to their optimal position, or worse
yet, trying to very quickly reattach my steering wheel to the desk
after I yanked it free in a hard bout of opposite lock.&nbsp; I
play a fair bit of games that use the H-shifter and I'd also like
to have it in a more natural position, down lower near my leg,
rather than on the same level as the wheel.</p>

<p><br />
 <img src="/media/1917/Next_Level_Wheel_Stand_with_G27.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="NLWS Entire" style="float: left;"/>My
solution to this problem, given all the parameters, was the Next
Level Racing Wheel, a sturdy frame that provides mounting points to
screw in a G27 kit, wheel, pedals and shifters.</p>

<p>The package arrived via rather large cardboard box, almost fully
assembled.&nbsp; The out of the box experience was great and the
frame was of high quality solid construction with an attractive
pearl black enamel finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only work on my part was fixing the gear shift lever on my
preferred side (left) and then attaching the G27 components using
the supplied allen key screws.&nbsp; All hole lined up perfectly
and all screws went in with minimum of fuss, a positive sign of a
quality build process.&nbsp; Another bonus, which I found
thoughtful, was the inclusion of four velcro strips which I used to
tuck the various cables of my G27 into the frame.&nbsp; After about
15 minutes of assembly I was plugged in and doing laps in my
favourite racing simulator.</p>

<p>The first few minutes of driving were spent adjusting the
pedals, sliding them further back, and raising the height of the
wheel, which also raises the height of the gearshift.&nbsp; The
wheel height extension arms have holes at regular intervals into
which you can screw a bolt, but I found it possible to still have a
sturdy setup with the screws firmly screwed in against the
metal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few laps of hard driving later and I was impressed. The entire
structure is solidly planted to the ground, a combination of the
weight of the unit and rubber feet preventing movement on my carpet
floored 'study'.&nbsp; I was also able to be very aggressive with
all of the pedals, gearshift, and wheel without them moving; the
hand screw adjustable pedal base remaining locked.</p>

<p>When I'm not playing racing games I simply unplug the USB cable
from my PC and drag the frame off of the side. It also folds up
vertically so it can be stored in a cupboard (or under a bed?), for
those people who have their PC's in a more open space or use it for
a wheel on a console plugged in to their lounge room
television.</p>

<p>Overall I give the unit 4.5/5 and I've got no complaints with
what was supplied.&nbsp; If I could do anything to improve the
package it would be to provide a way to secure the wheels on my
chair to the frame, at a positioning of my choosing.&nbsp; This
would ensure a perfect driving position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>We all have two feet and the brake of a race car generally
require the use of a foot: so which one is better and why?</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Left foot Trail Braking</li>

<li>Right foot Heel-Toe</li>

<li>Left foot increases entry speed</li>

<li>Right foot easier</li>
</ul>

<p>Racers having risen through the go-kart ranks and through open
wheelers are typically more left foot brakers.&nbsp; They use their
right foot to accelarate and their left foot to brake.&nbsp; This
is made mandatory in karting where it's just not possible to get
the right foot across to the brake, as you would in a road
car.&nbsp; It's also important when the vehicle you're driving is
low powered, such as a go-kart, because it allows you more time on
the thottle and you lose less revs.&nbsp; Left foot braking also
allows for trail braking, where you're applying both the brake and
the accellerator.&nbsp; The main problem with left foot braking in
a high performance vehicle is the level of skill needed.&nbsp; It's
an advanced technique.&nbsp; Most every driver is fimiliar with
right foot braking, through their experience driving their day to
day cars on public roads.&nbsp; This makes right foot braking more
natural and easier to regulate pressure and thus brake
consistently.</p>

<p>As mentioned, left foot braking allows trail braking, allowing a
driver to apply the brakes while turning, decreasing the braking
level as the corner speed decreases and corner angle
increases.&nbsp; This allows the driver to brake later than their
right foot counterparts, and gain a few meters on corner
entry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Left foot braking also means there is no transition from brake
to accelarator, where maybe up to half a second maybe lost at each
corner.&nbsp; This can make a big difference at tracks
like&nbsp;Monaco, where there are many low speed corners.&nbsp; You
can also use a more advanced technique known as cadence braking,
where the brakes are repitiively applied hard and then softer
during the one braking maneouver, in an attempt to reduce the risk
of a lock-up and decrease braking distances.&nbsp; This technique
is particularly successful in racing games.</p>

<p>Left foot braking can also be used to balance the car in high
speed corners, still trail braking, but the purpose here is to lose
maybe a 2-4 kph to prevent understeer or running off the
track.&nbsp; This is particular useful at tracks with high speed
corners such
as&nbsp;Spa-Francorchamps&nbsp;or&nbsp;Silverstone.&nbsp; It's
important to realise that a car is most stable when under power, so
lifting off the accelerator to prevent an off-track moment may
infact cause that moment.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1822/Heel_and_toe_braking.jpg" width="300" height="184" alt="Heel and Toe" style="float: left;"/>The alternative to trail
braking is "heel-toe", where as the name suggests, the driver uses
his toe or ball of the foot&nbsp;on the brake and his heel to
"blip" the throttle.&nbsp; In a clutchless world drivers don't need
to "heel-toe", as this was more brought about be ensuring the gear
speed in gearboxes are sychronised during a change, and with the
need to depress the clutch with the left foot braking had to be
done with the right.&nbsp; In an F1 car, right foot braking is only
beneficial when your left foot memory msucle is hardcoded to the
clutch pedal.&nbsp; Most real life F1 drivers are staunch supports
of left foot braking and simply cannot go as fast using the right
foot (also due to needing to apply brake and accelerator
simulatenously to balance the car).</p>

<p>Ultimately left foot braking is an advanced technique and as a
rookie, you may have more speed right foot braking, even if you
don't need to use a clutch.&nbsp; You can even use a combination of
the two, as I do, using right foot braking for corners where
minimal downforce is required.</p>

<p>This guide details how to set up your wheel for Codemasters F1
2011<img src="/media/1787/g27.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="G27 Wheel" style="float: right;"/>.&nbsp;
I've focussed on the Logitech G27 wheel, as it's the wheel I use
and the wheel in use by most of the competitors in the my f1
league.&nbsp; These settings also work for the Logitech Driving
Force GT wheel.</p>

<p>If your F1 car is handling like a sedan, your first point of
call would normally be car setup. Inappropriate controller setup
can also cause braking and accelation problems and for those with a
lack of fine motor control, adjusting pedal sensitivity may help.
&nbsp;You can adjust a number of settings for your wheel, both in
and out of game.</p>

<p>Using the full 900 degrees of rotation will not mean you have to
to shuffle your hands through multiple turns of the wheel to make
it round Casino at Monaco.</p>

<p>There are a number of In-Game settings that can be set, found in
the Advanced options for your wheel. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Logitech Profile Settings</h4>

<p>Below are my settings in the Logitech profiler.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/1912/wheel_profiler_settings.jpg" width="400" height="344" alt="wheel profiler"/></p>

<h4>In Game Settings</h4>

<table border="0" class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of rotation where steering is ignored. &nbsp;The
higher this value the more you can more your wheel without it
moving your car</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Saturation</strong></td>
<td>How quickly your wheel responds to your movements.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>The amount of turn of your wheel compared to the amount of
wheel turn in game. 100% is a 1:1 mapping</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of throttle that is ignored. The higher this value
the more you can press on the throttle pedal without applying
throttle in game</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the throttle pedal. Set to a lower value to
reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you like to push your throttle down
a long way when exiting corners, as a lower sensitivity will reduce
wheelspin</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of brake that is ignored. The higher this value the
more you can press on the brake pedal without applying the brake in
game</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the brake pedal. Set to a lower value to
reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you're applying too much brake and
frequently locking</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you feel your car setup is good but you still can't drive as
smoothly as you'd like, have a play with various values for the
above. &nbsp;I personally am leadfooted (some say I have too much
muscle, or perhaps I just need firmer pedals).</p>

<p>The settings I use for my Logitech G27 with 900 degrees of
rotation are as follows:</p>

<p><em>* I recently started using 200 degress of rotation and have
adjusted my settings according.<br />
 I find it doesn't feel much different but it does seem to
eliminate some of less responsive feel in the smaller wheel
movement</em></p>

<table border="0" class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Degress of rotation</strong></td>
<td width="70"><strong>900</strong></td>
<td width="70"><strong>453</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>100%</td>
<td>32%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This gives an in game wheel that maps 1:1 with your actual
steering wheel, so when you're turned 90 degrees left on your
wheel, your in game wheel is turned 90's left.&nbsp; Perfect.</p>

<p>A big change is the amount of Throttle and Brake saturation to
use.&nbsp; Using 100% will make the car far too sensistive to
throttle and brake inputs.&nbsp; For me 10% and 15% are good
levels.&nbsp; With 0% brake it's possible to mash the brake pedal
to the floor and not lock the brakes.&nbsp; This is unrealistic and
raises concerns over whether or not the driver is gettng the
maximum braking force.&nbsp; My preference is to adjust the
sensitivity such that the brakes will lock when the pedal is almost
fully depressed.&nbsp; I want to use a bit of skill in keeping from
locking, as well as ensuring I'm getting maximum braking force.</p>

<p>Another important setting is in the Force Feedback
section.&nbsp; Where you can the level of Force Feedback and wheel
weight.&nbsp; It is important to set the wheel weight a
value&nbsp;<strong>lower</strong>&nbsp;than the Force
Feedback.&nbsp; Otherwise you won't get the sensation of the
steering getter lighter as the front wheels lose grip.&nbsp; That
is you won't be able to detect when you're about to lose
control.</p>

<p>I've also experienced a problem where my wheel seems to
lag.&nbsp; It takes large movements of my wheel to move the in game
wheel a small amount, then moving my wheel only a little more makes
the game wheel turn much faster proportionately.&nbsp; To fix this,
ensure your&nbsp;<em>Override Input Devide Type&nbsp;</em> is set
to&nbsp;<em>None</em>&nbsp;(and not&nbsp;<em>Steering
Wheel</em>).</p>

<p>I've also found that how you click on "Start Game" determines
what controller will be used.&nbsp; If you select this with your
keyboards Enter key, the game will use Keyboard as the input
method.&nbsp; To use your wheel, instead press your wheels Start
button.&nbsp; On the Logitech G27 this is the second rightmost red
button above the gear stick, by default.&nbsp; You can change the
default start button using the method detailed&nbsp; <a
href="http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3406367/solution_F1_2011_default_contr.html">
here</a>.</p>

<h4>Advanced</h4>

<p>I've taken this one step further and changed the default
mappings for my G27, so I can use the buttons I want to use and
still use choose 'Logitech G27' in game.&nbsp; This is doubly
useful because I've found that the game occasionally loses my
mappings.&nbsp; Doing the following will mean your custom settings
will never again be lost.</p>

<p>Each device is mapped in a xml config file found in
the&nbsp;<strong>actionmap</strong>&nbsp;folder where your game is
installed.&nbsp; Within that folder you should find a file matching
your controller.&nbsp; For the Logitech G27, this is called
'<strong>G27 Racing Wheel.xml</strong>'.&nbsp; Before you make any
changes be sure to make a backup of this file.</p>

<p>Once you've got the file open in your favourite text editor,
you'll see it's just a typical xml file, made up
of&nbsp;<strong>Action</strong>&nbsp;elements
and&nbsp;<strong>Axis</strong>&nbsp;child elements. The Axis
elements are the mappings you want to modify.&nbsp; You'll see a
deviceName of&nbsp;<strong>04dc29b</strong>, that is your Logitech
G27. The other will be&nbsp;<strong>Keyboard</strong>.&nbsp; The
button names
are&nbsp;<strong>win_con_di_buttonX</strong>&nbsp;where X is the
button minus -1 on your logitech profiler.&nbsp; Eg Where the
Logitech Profile says Button 1, this is win_con_di_button0, as the
buttons are 0 based.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To modify the config file to suit personal tastes just go to the
appropriate action and enter the desired button.&nbsp; There are a
number of actions you don't need to worry about but the main ones (
you may want to change) are:</p>

<div class="post">
<ul>
<li>Quick Menu Up</li>

<li>Quick M enu Down</li>

<li>Quick Menu Left</li>

<li>Quick Menu Right</li>

<li>Enable KERS</li>

<li>Enable DCS (should be DRS!)</li>

<li>Look Back</li>

<li>Pause</li>

<li>OSD Swipe (This is 'Car Status' on the right hand side of the
screen)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>After you've modifed those you may also want to create a custom
profile in the Logitech Profile so you can create macro buttons to
quickly perform menu selections while racing, such as changing fuel
mixes and selecting tyres.&nbsp; Being able to quickly change your
fuel settings, multiple times per lap, is a help at the competitive
end of multiplayer racing, where 10ths of a second per lap make a
big difference over 30+ laps.</p>

<p>I've made the following changes</p>

<table border="0" class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th width="140"><strong>Game Action</strong></th>
<th width="100"><strong>Logitech Button</strong></th>
<th width="100"><strong>Keyboard</strong></th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Quick Menu Up</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Up</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Quick Menu Down</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Down</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Quick Menu Left</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Left</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Quick Menu Right</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Enable KERS</td>
<td>Button 8</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Enable DRS</td>
<td>Button 7</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Look Back</td>
<td>Button 21</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pause</td>
<td>Button 1</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Car Status/OSD Swipe</td>
<td>Button 19</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>To utilise Macros in game I needed to change the quick menu keys
to the arrow pad, from the dpad, and to&nbsp;<strong>set the
profile to persistent in the Logitech Profiler</strong>&nbsp;(that
bit is important!).&nbsp; To set that go to the menu and selection
Options -&gt; Global Profile settings.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1812/global_profiler_settings.png" width="500" height="330" alt="global profiler settings"/></p>

<p>I've also created a few Macros in the logitech profiler (turn
recording pauses on before recording the marco).&nbsp; You can see
which Macros go where in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="/media/1862/profiler.png" width="500" height="355" alt="profiler"/></p>

<table border="0" class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Conserve Fuel</th>
<td>Up, Up, Down</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Normal Fuel</th>
<td>Up, Up, Right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Rich Fuel</th>
<td>Up, Up, Up</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For&nbsp;<strong>Tyre Selection</strong>&nbsp;I use a cycling
command. You have to make the commands that will participate in the
cycle first and then create the order to cycle.&nbsp; Each press of
the button will cycle to the next tyre option.</p>

<table border="0" class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Prime Tyres</th>
<td>Up, Right, Up</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Option Tyres</th>
<td>Up, Right, Right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Intermediate Tyres</th>
<td>Up, Right, Down</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Wet Tyres</th>
<td>Up, Right, Left</td>
</tr>

<p>There are two ways to approach the Leage racing; one being to
turn up on race day and maybe get in an hour of&nbsp;practice prior
to the race using a quick setup or anothers' setup downloaded form
the web, the second being to develop a setup suited to your own
style during the week.&nbsp; If you want to be competitive for the
race then you're going to need to practice.&nbsp; Be assured the
top guys do; even those that already have a setup from previous
races at the same circuit.</p>

<p>Before you start any analysis, it's a good idea to grab
the&nbsp;<a href="/{localLink:1670}"
title="F1 Speed">F1Speed</a>&nbsp;tool, which you can incorporate
into your test runs while driving to give a quick feedback loop on
any setup or driving line changes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
 Here's a basic strategy for developing a competitive car for a
race weekend.</p>

<h4>6 Days out</h4>

<p>Befor you contemplate making your own car setup or analysing
different driving lines, you neeed know the track and to be able to
lap consistently. &nbsp;Start by loading up F1 Speed and use it's
data to help you gain consistency at a particular track. &nbsp;Make
use of the average lap value to try and get your fastest lap, your
average lap and you current lap as close together as possible, over
a decent number of laps (at least 15).</p>

<p>Start with the middle Quick Setup and put in enough laps so that
you lapping consistently as detailed above.&nbsp; This is your
baseline.&nbsp; Without this there is no point in starting to
investigate custom car setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you are lapping consistently you can begin to modify your
car setup. &nbsp;Start with the wings, trying them in various
combinations such as high downforce front and rear, high rear/low
front, high front/low rear, low front and rear. &nbsp;Each time you
make a setting that doesn't feel horrendous from the outset, give
it a few laps to let your driving style: braking, turning and
throttle on points adjust to the new car balance. Sometimes you
just know that the car is going to perform worse, other times it
might feel worse on corner entry but exit the corner faster.
&nbsp;Use F1Speed and F1PerfView to see the real difference each
change makes. It's hard to judge a half second or so, and over the
whole lap, a few tenths lost or gained here and there can add up to
a big change in lap time.</p>

<p>After wings, repeat the process for springs, then ARB, and
finally use alignment to fine-tune car handling, particular corner
exit. &nbsp;You'll also need to revisit the gear ratios to make
sure your hitting the rev limited in top gear on the longest
straight. &nbsp;Check out the guide on setting up your gearbox for
more information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>5 Days out</h4>

<p>Long Run Day. The aim for today is to establish tyre wear and
fuel consumption given your car setup.&nbsp; Remember a fully
fuelled car is gong to handle worse than an empty car.&nbsp; You
may need to raise the ride height to counter the extra
weight.&nbsp; Fill the car with 20+ Laps of fuel and prime tyres
and set out from pits.&nbsp; Build up pace and heat in your tyres,
feeling the extra weight of the car.&nbsp; Remember today you're
just trying to understand how long you can go on a set of
tyres.&nbsp; Ideally aim for 1 stop during the race, and the races
are about 25 laps, so you want to get around 17-20 laps from a set
of tyres and a 20 lap fuel load.</p>

<h4>4 Days out</h4>

<p>Time for some fun. Bolt on some options, drop your ride height,
suck your gut in and man up, it's time to try your qualifying
pace.&nbsp; Set your fuel mixture to rich, and perform a slow out
lap, then hang it out :D</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3 Days out</h4>

<p>While we'd like for it to always be sunny, with clear skies,
nature isn't always acommodating.&nbsp; Start a new Grand Prix with
a fully wet setting and repeat the steps from 6 Days out.&nbsp; I
wouldn't worry too much about a qualifying time.&nbsp; Get used to
the wet weather handling and work on your race setup.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2 Days out</h4>

<p>Somewhere in between bone dry and soaking wet, will lie
intermediate.&nbsp; If you're happy with your dry setup and ok with
your wet, try some intermediate running.&nbsp; Repeat the steps
from 6 Days out.&nbsp; If your dry pace is still wanting, continue
days 6 - 4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1 Day out</h4>

<p>Have a beer and rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Race Day</h4>

<p>Log in an hour before race start to check your game install,
your wheel, and your mic.&nbsp; An hour should give you enough time
to correct any problems (such as low batteries, or a misconfigured
wheel).&nbsp; I'd also advise doing 20 or so warmup laps.</p>

<p>You can also reduce your workload by sharing duties with your
teammate.</p>

<p>Unless you qualifying at the front of the pack in a grid that is
close together performance wise and you're competing in a short
race, it's likely you'll need to do some overtaking during the
race.</p>

<p>Overtaking involves two cars.&nbsp; It may seem obvious but many
less experienced drivers forget this basic fact.&nbsp; Whenever
you're relying on more than just your own control some caution
needs to be exercised.&nbsp; Effecting a clean overtake is more
than just noticing the car in front is going slower than you and
you might be able to make a pass at the next corner or down the
straight.&nbsp; A clean overtaken is made with knowledge of the
overtakees weakpoints, driving style, and your own driving
style.&nbsp; When overtaking for position it's a good idea to first
evaluate the driver in front, sizing up their weaknesses before
making a pass.&nbsp; Overtaking a backmarker is somewhat different
because typically there will be a substantial speed difference,
allowing for an easier and obvious overtake.</p>

<p>Passing on a straight is relatively straight forward.&nbsp; You
use your significant speed advantage to move out from behind the
car in front and drive around it.&nbsp; In the DRS age of modern
Formula 1 this has been made much more easy than it used to
be.&nbsp; Once you're in the DRS zone you simply activate DRS and
wait for the magic to happen.&nbsp; Once you're in front of the the
car you're overtaking you want to keep it that way so it's a good
idea to place your car in track position that will discourage the
trailing driver from attempting on overtake at the next
corner.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to overtake on the side
that gives you the inside line at the next turn.&nbsp; If you're
approaching a left hander, take the car on the left side.&nbsp;
This gives you options because if you have enough speed in the tow
to get up beside the car in front you can use the position of your
car to prevent the other car from undercutting you in the corner
(slowing down before you and taking the inside line to the corner
in the hopes for a better exit than you).&nbsp; Generally the
straight line overtake will be completed before the braking zone
for the next corner, or it becomes a corner overtake.</p>

<p>To overtake someone effectively and with respect to racing
ethics, good manners, theirs and your life, you need to ensure the
front of your car is at least level with the middle of their car
when you both enter the braking zone.&nbsp; From this position you
can block the other driver a you both enter the turn.&nbsp; If
you're on the inside line, which you should be, you can use the
position of your car to ensure the driver cannot pass and you are
entitled to take the racing line into the corner.</p>

            <bodyText><![CDATA[
<p>A racing circuit is comprised of left and right turns and
straights that link up to form an unbroken 'loop'.&nbsp; Pretty
simple stuff really.&nbsp; Each racing circuit is of varying
length, with some tracks up to 22m wide at points, like Malaysia,
and others are only 6m in points, like Monaco.</p>

<p>The fastest way to get from point A to point B is always going
to be a straight line. Thus, the basic key is to keep the car as
straight as possible as often as possible.&nbsp; This typically,
but not always, means finding the straightest line through a turn,
or series of turns.</p>

<p>Also, remember that when the wheels aren't pointed straight
ahead relative to the rest of the car, they're generating side
forces instead of forward forces.&nbsp; This means they're
basically wasting energy and decreasing the life of the tyre as
they slide laterally over the rod.</p>

<p>Now for some terminology.</p>

<p><strong>Braking point:&nbsp;</strong> This is the point where
you apply the brakes and begin deccelarating for the corner.</p>

<p><strong>Turn in:</strong>&nbsp;This is where you start turning
the wheel proper to get through the corner.</p>

<p><strong>Apex</strong>: This is the a very important component of
a turn and is the point where the car reaches the inside of the
turn and usually is right on the end of the track.</p>

<p><strong>Track out</strong>: is the exit of a turn and usually
found on the outside edge of the track.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/media/1872/racing_line.png" width="300" height="262" alt="raceline"/></p>

<p>You'll notice the above diagram defines early and late apexes.
The "standard" apex is the yellow line and is in between the other
two apexes.&nbsp; Typically you would use an early or late apex to
attempt an overtake, or if it suits your particular style of being
a late braker (late apex and sharper steering input, with a slower
entry speed).&nbsp; An early apex might also be employed if you're
overtaking or like to brake early, minimise steering inputs and
maintain a higher entry speed with lower mid corner and exit
speed.&nbsp; Where you overtake a car and the apex you employ to do
so depends on where the car is. For example, you might overtake on
the side by taking an earlier apex and "parking it" on the apex,
making the other car effective slow more than they would.&nbsp;
This is effective if they havent' also take an early apex, as it
ruins their line and exit speed.</p>

<p>Now you know the basics of cornering, the tricky part is
stringing it all together.&nbsp; At first, the best approach is to
take the shortest line between two points that is the standard apex
in the middle of the corner.&nbsp; You also need to allow for
change of direction (transitions) such as driving through
the&nbsp;<strong>Esses</strong>&nbsp;at Suzuka.&nbsp; In that case
you may not want to go completely from side to side because you're
going to be extendind the overall distance through the series of
turns.</p>

<p>Once you're comfortable with the basic line, start thinking
about your own prefferred driving style and how this effects your
line and apex of a corner.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that many tracks have green bollards on
the corners. These aren't there just to hit. &nbsp;These are corner
markers, used when the corner may be hard to spot. &nbsp;A good
example of this is at a newer track like Abu Dhabi. &nbsp;Here the
bollards are pretty much spot on the apex and you can aim your
front inside wheel at them and just skim them as you drive through
the corner. &nbsp;Certainly if you're consistently missing apexes
and the corner has a bollard, aim for the bollard. &nbsp;It's what
it is there for.</p>

<p>Finally I should mention braking.&nbsp; Theoretically all
braking should be done in the braking zone and when the car is
still going straight, before turn-in.&nbsp; Why? Again, think about
what the tyre is doing.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;tyres are pointed
straight ahead, they can be used exclusively for slowing the
car.&nbsp; If you turn the wheel while braking, the tyre must both
provide grip to slow the car and grip to turn the corner without
coming off.&nbsp; You also run the risk of pinching or locking a
brake and causing the car to spin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Trail
braking</strong>&nbsp;can be used succesfully though.&nbsp; This is
when braking is applied while turning, before the apex.&nbsp; Trail
braking should be the gentlest of braking though.&nbsp; If you stab
the brakes while turning, all you'll do is unsettle car and cause
under/oversteer.&nbsp; Gentle application of the brakes while
turning can help the car turn faster and hit your apex.&nbsp; It
will also allow you to start braking later, as you can stop braking
much closer to the apex.&nbsp; Generalyl trail braking requires
left foot braking.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="/{localLink:1627}"
title="Left foot versus right foot braking">here</a>&nbsp;for more
detailed information on left foot braking.</p>

<p>One final note (I promise), now that I've mentioned trail
braking:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Apex</strong>&nbsp;is the answer to
the question "When should I stop braking and start
accellarating.&nbsp; You should not accellarate before the apex or
you run the risk of overstreet/understeer.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This guide was written for F1 2011 but it's
completely relevant for all F1 2012 and until KERS and DRS are
removed from the game.</strong></p>

<p>Codemasters F1 2011 introduces two new features KERS and
DRS.&nbsp; KERS offers a 80bhp power boost for approximately 8
seconds, while DRS is a drag reduction system, providing lower
downforce and therefore higher speeds to the cars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Qualifying</h4>

<p>The use of KERS and DRS in qualifying for an F1 2012 brings a
small strategy element to the effort.</p>

<p>KERS can be applied at any time there is energy in the
batteries. If in cockpit view this available energy is noted by
pressing your KERS button. If nothing changes on your wheel (no K
beside the KERS value), you have nothing left. Otherwise you can
use KERS.&nbsp; My qualifying strategy is to save all my KERS for
the end of the qualifying out lap.&nbsp; Toward the end of this
lap, start using KERS at a time where you'll run out of KERS as you
cross the start-finish line, where it will be recharged
again.&nbsp; I prefer to save my KERS for when I'm in the mid to
high gears, 4th or above and on a long straight. &nbsp;Deploying
KERS at a low speed may help, if you're geared for it. Otherwise
you could just be generating wheelspin and wasting KERS.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use all the KERS before the start/finish
straight of your hot lap is track dependant, but I like to save a
bit for the end, particularly if I'm going to go for another hot
lap. If you're happy with your sector 1 and 2 times it's a good
idea to burn through your KERS before the last corner of the lap,
preferrably when existing low speed corners once you've got
traction and are not going to spin the rear wheels.</p>

<p>As DRS usage is unlimited on qualifying laps, I use DRS whenever
my front wheels are point straight and I'm past the apex of a
corner.&nbsp; I manually turn off DRS prior to entering corners
where I'm not using the brake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Race</h4>

<p>The same amount of KERS is available during the race as in
qualifying.&nbsp; DRS is limited to only one or two places on the
track and then only when you are within 1 second of the car in
front at the activiation zone.&nbsp; And then, only from lap 3
onwards and not in wet conditions.</p>

<p>KERS should be deployed at the start of the race once your
wheels stop spinning.&nbsp; How much you use depends on where your
car is positioned (who is in front of you).&nbsp; If you've got
drivers in front that will be slower off the line but are blockers,
you may not want to use your KERS off the line, as you'll waste
your advantage.&nbsp; Wait until you are right up behind them.</p>

<p>Once the start procedure has been completed KERS can be deployed
as per a qualifying lap, when you are in clear air.</p>

<p>KERS introduces some options for defensive and aggressive
driving, using it's power boost to both help defend against cars
looking to put a pass on you, and you wanting to make a move on a
car in front.&nbsp; Most tracks only have a few passing
opportunities and your KERS should be saved so it can be deployed
at this places, to maximise your drive out of the corner.&nbsp; To
that end, if using KERS to pass it's adviseable to get your car
pointing out of the corner as earlier as possible, especially in
comparisson to the person you are attempting to pass.&nbsp; This
will ensure your have maximum grip and can make the most of the
extra power at your disposal.&nbsp; Again, be careful to not spin
the wheels up when deploying KERS or you'll be wasting it.</p>

<p>Naturally you'll want to use DRS whever you can during a
race.</p>

<p>I'd heard about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iracing.com/"
target="_blank">iRacing</a>&nbsp;a while back, maybe a little over
12 months, but I'd also heard the graphics were rubbish, and it
wasn't a Fomula 1 game.&nbsp; That was enough to put me off
bothering to look, especially when F1 2010 from Codemasters was
just around the corner.</p>

<p>F1 2010 turned out to be a little worse than I wanted (read my
initial impressions&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.robertgray.net.au/2010/9/25/initial-impressions-of-f1-2010.aspx"
 target="_blank">here</a>) and the online play, while fun is tained
by people using grip hax and sloppy network code, amongst Many
other bugs in the game, least of all the way cars are setup.&nbsp;
I have been wanting something more realistic for a long time, ever
since Grand Prix 4.</p>

<p>Yesterday&nbsp;a guy I raced with in the Atomic F1 2010
competition gave his recommendation of iRacing and knowing what a
motorsport fan, and games reviewer he is (former editor of Atomic
magazine) I thought I should consider it properly.&nbsp; I watched
a few videos and read a few reviews on Friday evening and was
enthralled, and at $12 for 3 months thought I'd give it a shot.</p>

<p>I wasn't disappointed and boy is it difficult.&nbsp; I also love
the sound of the MX-5 that comes as the entry level car.&nbsp;
Coupled with my Logitech G27, the use of the H-pattern gear-shifter
and clutch make for a great experience.</p>

<p>Here's some of the features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has their own governing body F.I.R.S.T., to regulate the
championships, equivalent to F1's FIA.</li>

<li>Runs world wide championships with $10,000 to the grand
champion, as well as other perks.</li>

<li>Is a serious 'sport', rather than a computer game.&nbsp; Think
of iRacing as like any other motorsport, except there are no
physical cars and tracks.</li>

<li>A license system awards and takes away points for any on track
incidents (contact, losing control, coming off the track), it
rewards clean driving over winning (though that's big points). As
you move to a higher license class, better cars open up. This
completely eliminates the idiot factor, and reduces accidental
contact to very rare.</li>

<li>It's a full championship that lasts 12 weeks (I think), with
you best 8 race results counting as your points. So you race every
day, not trying too hard to win, just stay on and stay clean, and
in the end that's what's rewarded - so there's no more desperate
lunging at the first corner - if things don't work out in a race
just race again to keep your average up.</li>

<li>The car feel is beyond amazing. By far the best car physics
ever.</li>

<li>The range of cars is awesome. Something for everyone.</li>

<li>They constantly update, patch, release new cars and tracks.
This is the WoW of racing - in terms of developer care.</li>

<li>There are Aussie servers.&nbsp; Many many Aussies play. Races
are always a full field.</li>

<li>Scheduling is usually a new race every hour or two, per
series.</li>

<li>Every week or so they switch tracks (in a series), so you get a
good go, and no more week of practice to see it all fall apart in
the single race that matters (like we do with F1).</li>

<li>All the racers are very very good, and take it seriously,
though it's welcoming for noobs. Everyone uses real names too. A
nice touch that helps keep it serious.</li>

<li>There's an F1 car, a Williams and it shits on the Codemaster
(F1 2010) cars from the moon.</li>

<li>There's series of Driver instructor videos that coach you in
your quest to become the next Mark Webber.&nbsp; From my limited
experience with V8 supercar school on the gold coast, this
inclusion is realistic and good advice and adds to the depth of the
entire simulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first experience in iRacing was driving the Legends Ford '34
Coupe around Lime Rock Park. &nbsp;My immediate impression
satisfaction with how realistically the car handled my inputs, and
how the braking and acceleration effected the vehicle when turning.
&nbsp;Within the first hour I'd got my time into the 1:05's, which
is, at least, better than another first timer I read on a&nbsp; <a
href="http://rookieracer.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-rookie-report-july-5-2010-lime-rock-park/">
blog</a>. &nbsp;I had a quick go of the track in the Mazda MX-5 and
was impressed with the way the clutch and gears worked
realistically, even if that meant I was a terrible gear changer.
&nbsp;I kept getting the coordination wrong and gears wouldn't go
in, costing me valuable time. &nbsp;Well I have been driving
automatics for the last 6+ years.</p>

<p>My Atomic friend informed me of the Races held every hour, with
this week being Laguna Seca, for Rookies.&nbsp; Cool! I wanted to
try out the corkscrew and did about 30mins practice before joining
my first race, managing a qualifying time of 1:47.8 , which while
not good was still a decent starting place, especially as I'd only
been playing the game for about 2 hours total.&nbsp; I got punted
off the track on the first lap and broke my car, leaving it pulling
to severely to the right and my lap times terrible. I finished
last.</p>

<p>I did two more races and all went the same way, me finishing
last.&nbsp; My rating is now down to 2.05, from 2.50 and instead of
getting closer to jumping up out of the Rookie class, I'm sinking
further back.</p>

<p>I started getting a bit dispirited with my ability, weird, cause
it was only my first day, and less than 6 hours total experience.
However, I like motorsport and racing cars, and I fancy myself a
bit.</p>

<p>Another Atomic member, and long time player told me to try the
regulated Practice sessions, that include other drivers, to give me
a better feel for the race environment.</p>

<p>I have just come off my first hour long practice (formal
Practice, not Test) session now and it's like a switch flipped. Not
sure why, but pretty much straight away I was not
getting&nbsp;incidents&nbsp;and wasn't varying wildly with my
braking. Better yet my feel for the car has come good; I can lose
it and slide (albeit widely) using opposite lock , the clutch , and
the gas, and not spin, go off track, or get a car control caution.
I'm also hitting the corkscrew consistently and plenty fast
enough.</p>

<p>I've just turned in a 1:46.482, which while not fast, at least
put me in the middle of the pack between 1:45.057 at the top and a
1:49.020 (if you discount the 2:07.314) at the bottom. Best yet,
because I've now got a feel for the car and can get it to respond
consistently to my inputs, driving has become a whole bunch more
fun. &nbsp;An example being turn 1/2 at Leguna Seca. &nbsp;It's
approached in 5th (in the MX-5 Cup car) and shifted down into
third. &nbsp;It's basically a double apex turn, at least the way I
drive it, although I've seen other racers brake late and run to the
edge of the track and make it a single apex. &nbsp;Anyway, earlier
in the day if I braked near or on my limit I'd lose the back end
and spin out of control. &nbsp;Tonight I was still braking and the
back end would come out and try and turn me but I'd balance the
steering, throttle and clutch to get the car to slide and still
continue on, not recording a Loss of Control incident.</p>

<p>Inside iRacing's website is a detailed profiling system that
makes Career Mode in F1 2010 look ridiculous. &nbsp;Here all your
statistics are listed for every racing you participate in
(something else I didn't mention is that iRacing uses your real
name, and not some garble of characters like in online racing
games, adding to the simulation).</p>

<p>Simply put iRacing is the "game" (I must be careful there as
it's not a game, but a simulator) I've been wanting for
years.&nbsp; With an active team and an ever growing list of tracks
and cars, I'm going to be here a while.&nbsp; The business case for
my permanent simulator cockpit just got very real.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've just finished listening to the
first iRacing podcast and the guy pretty much exactly shares my
opinion. &nbsp;It's a salient thought I did have when I first
turned on iRacing. &nbsp;We both are in our mid 30's and both were
avid World of Warcraft fans. &nbsp;With iRacing we're gaining
skills that actual help us improve in the game. &nbsp;In WoW,
you're questing and getting gold and armour pieces etc, and sure,
you're gaining some better understanding of shot rotation and how
to defeat bosses etc, but iRacing has a direct benefit to how well
you can do in the sim (also apparently to how well you can do on
real life race track). &nbsp;Both are similar in a way, WoW is a
MMO (massively multiplayer online game) and iRacing is a MMO Sim,
with 20,000+ members. &nbsp;And both are massive time drains.
&nbsp;Serendipitously I cancelled my WoW sub last weekend, bored of
the game and it's repetitive time wasting for no real benefit.</p>

<h3>Car Setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use negative and positive camber to ensure your tyres are
getting the most tread possible onto the road surface during
cornering.</li>

<li>Increased positive castor will cause increased negative camber
on the outside wheel during turning. &nbsp;Adjust the two in
tandem. &nbsp;Increased positive castor makes the steering more
heavy. &nbsp;Never use negative castor.</li>

<li>Generally, front toe-in causes the car to understeer on initial
turn in. &nbsp;Front toe-out has the opposite effect, causing
initial oversteer. &nbsp;Remember this is only on initial turn in
not mid corner or on the exit.</li>

<li>The lower the ride height the better, providing the car doesn't
bottom out or reduce suspension travel. &nbsp;Adjusting the 'rake'
(the difference between the front and rear ride heights) is done to
fine tune handling.</li>

<li>Try to run the softest possible rear springs and set the front
springs to balance the car after the rear is set. &nbsp;Harder
front springs will reduce weight transfer speed under braking and
therefore oversteer.</li>

<li>Tyres give up the most grip between 180 and 220 Fahrenheit (82
- 104 Celcius). &nbsp;</li>

<li>Temperature difference between the front and rear tyres
indicate a balance problem. &nbsp;Hotter fronts and the car is
understeering. &nbsp;Hotter rears and you may be getting too much
wheelspin out of corners. &nbsp;Keep tyre temperatures basically
equal on all four tyres.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Driving Fast</h3>

<ul>
<li>Positions are not made in corners, they are made on the
straights.</li>

<li>The secret to a fast lap lies in the corners because this
effects straight line speed (see previous point). &nbsp;The most
important corner on a track is the fastest corner leading on to a
straight. &nbsp;The least important corner is the slow speed corner
leading to another corner. &nbsp;Always prioritorise corners
leading onto straights.</li>

<li>Use the entire track when cornerning. &nbsp;The larger the
radius, the more speed can be carried through a corner.</li>

<li>Firstly master the ideal racing line</li>

<li>Secondly master the acceleration phase of the corner.</li>

<li>Thirdly master the braking into a corner, braking as late as
possible</li>

<li>Finally master carrying mid corner speed. Master these in
order.</li>
</ul>
